<p>This is another talk on philosophy.  I recorded it while hiking.  The
main points are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A consideration of the practical aspects of my philosophy, such as
the unity between mind and body (talking and breathing, walking,
etc.).</li>
  <li>Honesty and introspection are the basics of philosophy.  We start
doing philosophy when we develop an awareness of what we do
(mindfulness).</li>
  <li>A case study on dating.  Being honest about our humanity helps us
avoid the trap of being disappointed the whole time.</li>
  <li>How honesty helps us overcome our ego and be more considerate,
empathetic persons.</li>
  <li>I understand why one is sceptical about the practicality of
philosophy because (1) it is broad in scope and (2) there is a
communication problem, including the pretentiousness of certain
intellectuals.</li>
</ul>
