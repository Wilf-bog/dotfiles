<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello,</p> <p>I wish to sort directories before files, within the Completions buffer. This buffer is shown when executing C-x C-f TAB TAB, and should be done within a directory that contains directories and folders.</p> <p>The ls command has the option --group-directories-first, which is the behaviour I would like to achieve within the Completions buffer.</p> <p>Any insight is appreciated.</p> <p>sortdirectoriesfirst</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/sortdirectoriesfirst"> /u/sortdirectoriesfirst </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/1e86nuz/completions_buffer_sort_directories_before_files/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/1e86nuz/completions_buffer_sort_directories_before_files/">[comments]</a></span>
