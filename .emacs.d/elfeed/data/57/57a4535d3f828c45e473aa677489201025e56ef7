<p>Yes indeed, why not let your reading be a smorgasbord of serendipity?</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s Anna Funder, author of <em>Wifedom: Mrs Orwell&rsquo;s Invisible Life</em>, on working at the University of Melbourne English Department library as a student:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“It sounds prehistoric now, but I sat at the front desk, typing out index cards for new acquisitions or requests from staff for books or journals — anything from the latest novel, to psychoanalysis, poetry or medieval studies. I read things that had nothing to do with my studies: a smorgasbord of serendipity. Despite my time there, I have never understood the Dewey decimal system: how can numbers tell you what a book is, to a decimal point?” - <a href="https://www.sl.nsw.gov.au/stories/every-book-you-could-want-and-many-more">Every book you could want and many more</a></p>
</blockquote>
