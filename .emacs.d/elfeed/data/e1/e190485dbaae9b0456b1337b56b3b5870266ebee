<p>While the crowd at sxsw2024 <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/sxsw-crowd-boos-ai-video-2024-3">booing a sizzle reel</a> of people either promising the beauty of the future &#8220;AI&#8221; will bring or claiming it to be &#8220;without alternative&#8221; is funny and went viral for all the right reasons, this event speaks to a deeper shift in perception.</p>



<p>As Brian Merchant <a href="https://www.bloodinthemachine.com/p/the-tide-is-turning-against-openai">writes</a>: </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>&#8220;For the buzziest tech of the moment to get shouted down at *SXSW* speaks volumes about the scale and nature of the animosity generative AI has amassed. The tech is seen, here, as exploitative by tastemakers and *by technologists*.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>But I&#8217;d go further: It&#8217;s not just the public perception that OpenAI has been trying to plant in our collective understanding is falling apart due to the actions of that strange company, I think the actual narrative of &#8220;AI&#8221; is untangling.</p>



<p>Because where are all the promised gains in efficiency? Where is the better world? All we see is a wasteful technology that&#8217;s propped up by VC and Microsoft money that&#8217;s easily detected as a way to further centralize our digital infrastructures while laying our digital spaces to waste.</p>



<p>After having played with ChatGPT many people don&#8217;t really integrate it into their practices because these systems are just not that good and if you care about quality anything after &#8220;quick sketches in the beginning of the process&#8221; is unthinkable.</p>



<p>Some systems labeled &#8220;AI&#8221; today will stick around. Especially the non-generative stuff (for image processing, object detection, pattern recognition in data streams, heuristics to detect errors in work products, etc.) but a lot of the generative &#8220;AI&#8221; field is just spam creation. And it&#8217;s actually making some &#8211; especially creative things &#8211; harder to achieve.</p>



<p>Famous film critic Roger Ebert once said &#8220;The Muse visits during the act of creation, not before.&#8221; and the booing is people coming back to realizing this simple fact. You are not creative and then create something, you become creative by working on something, creativity is a byproduct of work.</p>



<p>In this way &#8220;AI&#8221; is deeply dehumanizing: Making the spaces and opportunities for people to grow and be human smaller and smaller. Applying a straitjacket of past mediocrity to our minds and spirits.</p>



<p>And <em>that</em> is what is being booed: The salespeople of mediocrity who&#8217;ve made it their mission to speak lies from power. The lie that only tech can and will save us. The lie that a bit of statistics and colonial, mostly white, mostly western data is gonna create a brilliant future. The lie that we have no choice, no alternatives.</p>



<p>Luddism is back, baby.</p>
