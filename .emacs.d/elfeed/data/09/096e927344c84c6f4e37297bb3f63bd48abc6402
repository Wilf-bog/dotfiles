<p>In this short video I show the dam I have created that lets me bring
water into the hut. Today I had to add some gypsum around it to
reinforce its walls. There is not much water flowing this time of the
year, though what I have is enough for my needs (plus other
adjustments I have made to my water consumption).</p>
