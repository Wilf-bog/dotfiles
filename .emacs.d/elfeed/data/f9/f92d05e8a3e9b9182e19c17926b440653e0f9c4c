<p>🐙 Octopus intelligence is intriguing. Having read Ray Naylor&rsquo;s <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781399600477"><em>The Mountain in the Sea</em></a>  📚, I now want to try <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780008226282"><em>Other Minds: The Octopus and the Evolution of Intelligent Life</em></a> by Peter Godfrey-Smith. I&rsquo;d also like to read <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780316452540"><em>Children of Ruin</em></a> by Adrian Tchaikovsky, which has a somewhat similar theme.</p>
