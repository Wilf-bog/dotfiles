<p style="font-size:21px">I&#8217;m pleased to report that allies in Greece have undertaken the task of translating and publishing a broad overview of many of my past essays in a new anthology published in Greek (see <a href="https://www.kianavgi.gr/el/biblia/dokimia/epanastasi-gia-ton-21o-aiona">here</a>). Similarly entitled as my last book publication <a href="https://link.springer.com/book/10.1057/9781137440723">The Politics of Total Liberation: Revolution for the 21st Century</a>, translated previously into<a href="http://www.orticaeditrice.it/prod.php?id=76"> Italian</a> and <a href="https://www.echoverlag.de/23/Totale+Befreiung.html">German</a>, this book features a new introduction for the lively Greek political culture, along with numerous past essays representative of my viewpoints. including &#8220;The Animal Standpoint: Rethinking History, Social Theory, Environmentalism, and Politics,&#8221; &#8220;The Rise (and Fall) of Critical Animal Studies: Putting Theory into Action and Animal Liberation into Higher Education,&#8221; &#8220;From ‘Man the Hunter’ to Homo X: Rethinking Human Nature,&#8221; &#8220;The Killing Fields of South Africa: Eco-Wars, Species Apartheid, and Total Liberation,&#8221; &#8220;The New Abolitionism: Capitalism, Slavery and Animal Liberation,&#8221; &#8220;The Paralysis of Pacifism//Defending Innocent Animals Under Attack: A Case for Extensional Self-Defense,&#8221; &#8220;Minding the Animals: Ethology and the Obsolescence of Left Humanism,&#8221; &#8220;Total Liberation and Moral Progress: The Struggle for Human Evolution,&#8221; and &#8220;Failed Species: The Rise and Fall of the Human Empire.&#8221;</p>

<p style="font-size:21px">The blurb for the book reads:</p>



<p style="font-size:21px"><em>&#8220;The texts in this collection highlight the oppression of animals as an urgent issue of utmost importance both on a moral and political level and in relation to the current climate crisis. According to the author, the century we are in is the one that will judge the viability of humanity&#8217;s future. To vindicate this struggle requires not only changing our habits and the way we treat animals, but also forming new political alliances that go beyond the known existing boundaries. Acknowledging the great degree of difficulty of the undertaking but without wallowing in defeatism, Steven Best scientifically deconstructs the dominant myths surrounding human nature, uses the &#8220;animal point of view&#8221; to re-read the human system of domination, and reminds us that, if necessary, the planet will continue its journey without us.&#8221;</em></p>



<p style="font-size:21px">Greek philosopher Panagiotis Tsiamouras wrote a thorough <a href="https://www.fractalart.gr/epanastasi-gia-ton-21o-aiona-i-politiki-tis-olikis-apeleytherosis/">review</a> of the book, and the Google translation into English can be read <a href="https://www-fractalart-gr.translate.goog/epanastasi-gia-ton-21o-aiona-i-politiki-tis-olikis-apeleytherosis/?_x_tr_sl=el&amp;_x_tr_tl=en&amp;_x_tr_hl=en&amp;_x_tr_pto=wapp">here</a>. Those interested can find past interviews I gave to Greek media on <a href="https://antispe-squat-gr.translate.goog/δράσεις/πορειες-συγκεντρωσεις/συνέντευξη-του-steven-best-και-του-brendon-mcnally-στον-98fm/?_x_tr_sl=el&amp;_x_tr_tl=en&amp;_x_tr_hl=en&amp;_x_tr_pto=wapp">animal liberation </a>and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pec0RXjKweg">the animal standpoint</a>, as well as a lecture on total liberation at an Athens ecology conference which can be found<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTxxcgT0bjo"> here</a> (Part 1) and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZCH5yMinB0">here</a> (Part 2). It is my sincere hope that this new anthology above advances the cause of animals and total liberation in Greece, and I owe a very special thanks to Kostas Alexiou for his hard work translating and publishing this volume. I am working currently on assembling and revising a similar collection of essays, old and new, for an English-speaking audience.</p>
