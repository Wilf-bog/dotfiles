<p>On April 25, I published the first beta version of “Prot’s Dots For
Debian” (PDFD).  Since then I made a series of incremental refinements
and changes.  PDFD is a complete guide to reproducing my custom desktop
session on Debian 10 ‘buster’.  Today I added the finishing touches and
am happy to announce that the first official release is available.</p>

<p>I am publishing this a few days prior to the release of Debian 10, which
will happen on July 6, just to be sure that everything works as
intended.</p>

<p>As already noted in the previous announcement about PDFD:</p>
