<p>I walked and talked philosophy for an hour.  In this presentation, I
talked about the substance of values, with forgiveness as a case in
point.  To make the topic more relatable, I described what “hubris” is
and offered some concrete examples.</p>

<p>The contents in brief:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Real story of a person that would not let go of something trivial
that happened more than 30 years ago.</li>
  <li>Link it to the mistake of appreciating forgiveness or anything
pertaining to self-improvement only with regard to its ultimate
rewards.  This also relates to the previous entry <a href="https://protesilaos.com/books/2022-10-21-self-improvement/">on
self-improvement</a>.</li>
  <li>The practical aspect of forgiveness in the here-and-now is that we
keep ourselves free from useless burdens, else garbage.  We can then
focus our limited resources on something more useful.</li>
  <li>Talk about the myth of Sisyphus and how it essentially describes the
struggles of the person who does not let go.</li>
  <li>Comment on the theme of non-ownership, though it is not the focus
here.  I talked more about this in <a href="https://protesilaos.com/books/2022-10-17-loss-entitlement-presence/">loss, entitlement, and
presence</a>.</li>
  <li>Explain another story of me not becoming a priest and how it relates
to this case.</li>
  <li>Talk about the misplaced ritualistic view we have of certain
precepts.  Basically, we miss the point as we cater to the
appearances while disregarding the essential teachings.</li>
