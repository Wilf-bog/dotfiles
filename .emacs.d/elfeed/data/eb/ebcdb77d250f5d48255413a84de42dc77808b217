<p>What follows is my translation of a song titled “Τρένο” (Train) by an
old Greek rock band known as Τρύπες (Trypes) :

<p>First I share the original lyrics, followed by my translation, and then
my commentary:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Τρένο

Όταν θα 'ρθείς
να με ξεθάψεις απ' τις στάχτες
και διώξεις από πάνω μου
όλη τη σκουριά
και ξαναβάλεις
τις ρόδες μου σε ράγες
και εγώ αρχίσω να κυλάω ξανά

Τότε οι λύπες θα με ψάχνουν
κι άνεργες θα θρηνούν
θα πέφτουν μανιασμένες οι βροχές
και θα ρωτούν

Τι έγινε κείνο το τρένο που έβλεπε
τα άλλα τρένα να περνούν
</code></pre></div></div>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Treno (Train)

When you come
to unearth me from the ashes
and clear off of me
all the rust
and place again
my wheels on rails
and I start rolling again

Then the sorrows will be searching for me
and now idle will be mourning
Rains will be falling maniacally
and they will be asking

What happened to that train which spectated
the other trains passing by
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It is said that a picture is worth a thousand words.  Yet it also is
true that a word evokes a thousand images.  <em>Train</em>, an otherwise simple
song, is a case in point.  It tells the story of one who lives from the
sidelines.  This is a life that goes to waste, covered in ashes and
eaten away by rust.  It is the grinding routine of a person who does not
assume agency; a person conditioned into thinking of their self as
worthless.</p>

<p>The “sorrows” and the “rains” represent the naysayers in our life.
These can be other people, though they may also emanate from within:
figments of our imagination which personify a value we have assumed as
truthful <em>a priori</em>.</p>

<p>[ I make a relevant point about thinking of ourselves as a failure in a
recent presentation: <a href="https://protesilaos.com/books/2022-06-25-knowledge-presence/">On learning and being
present</a>. ]</p>

<p>They are not questioning us because of how evil they are.  Such is a
rarity—bullies can be misguided too.  It simply has to do with the
fact that they echo what they have heard without thinking it through.</p>

<p>Take the common beliefs in favour of marriage as a means of fulfilment:
the normativity of marriage and all the institutional arrangements
revolving around it or predicated on it.  You have to marry and you must
do it while you are young.  If, for whatever reason, you are past thirty
and have not married yet, others in your milieu will think of you as a
failure of sorts.</p>

<p>“Where is your wife?  How many children do you have?”  I lost count of
the times I’ve heard these…  If you believe in the notion that you are
a person manqué, a “half” who must necessarily find some “other half” to
qualify as a fully fledged human being, you will spend the remainder of
your days belittling yourself for your perceived worthlessness.  You are
conditioned into thinking that not conforming with a social norm is
indicative of a defect of yours.  Much like the train in the song, you
will live in sorrow, merely spectating the others.  You do not
appreciate what you have—there is so much you could do with it,
provided you showed the requisite self-respect.</p>

<p>Make no mistake: there is nothing wrong with marriage per se.  It is the
“you must do it” part that is problematic.  It serves as a simplistic
yardstick by which everyone is measured.  A one-size-fits-all that turns
into a ritual of casting everyone into a mould.  Do it and you are
worthy; don’t conform and you jeopardise your position.  There is no
nuance, no tolerance for the hitherto undefined.  Such a crude
formulation incentivises people to conform with a role.  Those who
accomplish the task in this little game earn a type of credit— the
superficial respect of others—which they hope to redeem in exchange
for some other goods.  Not pursuing those tokens means that you lose out
on the subsequent transactions.  How unfortunate!</p>

<p>The song starts with a call to a figure who liberates us from the
fetters that hold us still.  This can represent an altruistic fellow who
helps us accept who we are, or it symbolises a revelation that springs
to mind.  Whether someone else puts us back on our tracks or we achieve
it by ourselves, we take the initiative: instead of spectating others
while being sad, we venture fearlessly into the great unknown, at peace
with what our nature renders inescapable.</p>

<p>The naysayers find comfort in your inertia: they work laboriously
towards that end as it ultimately <a href="https://protesilaos.com/interpretations/2022-06-28-alkinoos-mirror/">justifies their
condition</a>.
Do not believe their value judgements to be true in advance.  Move on.
Start rolling again.  Find your own way.  Let them grow paranoid as they
wonder what happened to the one they once held captive.</p>

<p>You are free.  The fetters are now theirs.</p>
