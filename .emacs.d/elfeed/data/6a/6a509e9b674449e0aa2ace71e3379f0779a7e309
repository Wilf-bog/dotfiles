<p>Merge branch ‘restart-development’</p>

<p>I am restarting the development of MCT with the sole intent to keep it
in good working condition for the handful of users who like it.  I do
not plan to expand the scope of the package.  Instead, I am removing
certain features of dubious value and am cleaning up the code (which
was in a good state, all things considered).</p>

<p>To recap:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>MCT is a layer of interactivity on top of the default Emacs
minibuffer and the <em>Completions</em> buffer.  It treats the two as a
unified space and provides commands to intuitively move between
them.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>MCT provides a facility for “live completions” which automatically
update the <em>Completions</em> buffer given certain conditions.  Users
have access to options for a passlist and blocklist which further
control what should be live updated.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On 2022-04-14 I had announced the discontinuation of the project’s
development:
<a href="https://protesilaos.com/codelog/2022-04-14-emacs-discontinue-mct/">https://protesilaos.com/codelog/2022-04-14-emacs-discontinue-mct/</a>.
The reason was that Emacs 29 was assuming certain features that MCT
had.  I thought that Emacs 29 would provide an MCT-equivalent
experience and was making way for that eventuality.  It turns out
that I was mistaken: MCT is still more featureful and might show the
direction for future developments on Emacs 30.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Now the other news:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>I still think <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">vertico</code> by Daniel Mendler is the best User Interface
for the minibuffer.  Where relevant in my Emacs coaching sessions, I
always recommend Vertico: <a href="https://protesilaos.com/coach">https://protesilaos.com/coach</a>.  It is
robust and highly configurable.  What MCT does, Vertico does better.
My plan for my personal config is to have two modules, one for
Vertico and another for MCT, so that I can use the former by default
and the latter when needed.  (Again, I want to maintain MCT but will
not add major new features.)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have removed support for Emacs 27.  This was a mistake from day
one.  Emacs 27 cannot show the <em>Completions</em> buffer in one-column
view and thus lacks the primary user-facing aspect of MCT.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have removed everything that has to do with in-buffer completion
(<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">completion-in-region</code>).  While it is nice to have a uniform
interface for completions in the minibuffer and inside buffers, the
latter was never good enough.  This is not an MCT problem, but how
inherently limited the <em>Completions</em> are in the scenario where the
minibuffer is not activated.  I will continue using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">corfu</code> by
Daniel Mendler.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For a brief period of time I experimented with various extensions to
the core MCT functionality (e.g. integrating with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">avy.el</code>.  These
are all removed.  There now is a single ‘mct.el’ file.  It works
fine for what it was originally designed to do: enhance the
minibuffer UI.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
