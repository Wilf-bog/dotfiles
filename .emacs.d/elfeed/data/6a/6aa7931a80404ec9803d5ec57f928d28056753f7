<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>In the trend of recent posts on this sub I want to where the myth about setting the value of <code>gc-cons-threshold</code> high to improve performance came from. (I feel fairly confident in calling the idea that this improves performance a myth given that Emacs maintainers have frowned upon this practice on this sub)</p> <p>Also, are there any other common emacs myths that still go around that should be debunked? I think the idea that using tool-bar-mode or menu-bar-mode hampers your learning of the keyboard shortcuts is unfair and fewer &quot;Intro to Emacs&quot; guides should ask newcomers to turn them off.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/aloeveracity9"> /u/aloeveracity9 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/1e6tzcy/emacs_myths/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/1e6tzcy/emacs_myths/">[comments]</a></span>
