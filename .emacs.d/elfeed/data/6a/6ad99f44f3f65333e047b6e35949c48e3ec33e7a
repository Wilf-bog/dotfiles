<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello I am trying to write my emacs config from scratch. It is going well so far i have been able to set the font and the sizes of org mode headers. But I feel like font size proportion to each other is not pleasing like default font size, the headers font size, the tabs titles and the status line. I want to know if you have a method or a plug-in to harmonize all proportions maybe even introduce a golden ratio to make everything pleasing to the eye. Thank you.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Xnomai"> /u/Xnomai </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/1e78vxs/font_sizes_in_gui/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/1e78vxs/font_sizes_in_gui/">[comments]</a></span>
