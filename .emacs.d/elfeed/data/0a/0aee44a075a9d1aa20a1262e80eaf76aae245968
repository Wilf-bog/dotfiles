<p>In this ~40-minute-long video I walk and talk about the connection of
living in the here-and-now while seeking pleasurable experiences.  My
points in brief:</p>

<ul>
  <li>An explanation of what “hedonism” means.  It comes from the Greek
word <em>ηδονή</em> (hedony, pronounced as “ee-thó-nee”).</li>
  <li>Practical example of what “presence” is using my unscripted video
presentation as a case in point.</li>
  <li>Presence lets us break the cycle of overthinking by acting.</li>
  <li>Action is actual: it always happens in the here-and-now.</li>
  <li>Presence is about recognising our humanity’s limited resources.  Our
time is finite, we always face opportunity costs (we face
trade-offs), and we also are not omniscient.  We fathom all
eventualities in all possible scenaria: we thus act under these
constraints and cannot afford to reach perfection before doing so.</li>
  <li>Extensive commentary on these questions
    <ol>
      <li>If you are always present, doesn’t that make you always react to
stimuli?</li>
      <li>If you are always reacting to whatever comes your way, won’t you
be mindlessly engaging in the pursuit of pleasures (hedonism)?</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Having presence does not mean that we lose our knowledge and sense
of direction.  We still carry out purposeful actions.  We thus are
not reacting mindlessly to phenomena.</li>
  <li>“Pursuing pleasure” is framed as something inherently bad:
basically, you just let your body dictate all aspects of your
experience.  This is a misconception.</li>
  <li>Why is the pursuit of pleasures equated with mindlessness?</li>
  <li>Examples of pleasure, such as enjoying the awesomeness of the great
outdoors, and blotting out all the noise and irrelevant emotions
induced by social media.</li>
  <li>Introduction to the concepts of “Apollonian” and “Dionysian”.</li>
  <li>Explanation how those set up a false binary.</li>
  <li>Long discussion on the multifacetedness of the human condition.  We
are body and mind, we have emotions and spiritual needs.</li>
  <li>We cannot deny our reality, such as to pretend that we are purely
spiritual while being embodied.</li>
  <li>Connecting the threads between hedonism, presence, multifacetedness,
and a moderate disposition.</li>
  <li>Closing thoughts with a real story about an introvert who wanted to
be a sportsperson in their late twenties.  I published that on my
website’s “commentary” section:
