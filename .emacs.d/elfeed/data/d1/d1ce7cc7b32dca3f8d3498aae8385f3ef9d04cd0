<p>Even before &#8220;lean&#8221; became the battlecry of everyone making work a bit more annoying companies were focused on being efficient. Optimizing processes, reducing waste to squeeze more profit from the materials and labor put into their respective processes. And in that context this form of thinking does make some form of sense: If you understand the job of a company to maximize profit, optimization and efficiency are core values. <sup data-fn="967b6cae-18be-458a-bfdc-5e90228bc312" class="fn"><a href="#967b6cae-18be-458a-bfdc-5e90228bc312" id="967b6cae-18be-458a-bfdc-5e90228bc312-link">1</a></sup></p>



<p>This train of thought have lead to the narrative that private companies are so much more efficient than public infrastructures &#8211; so much so that some people argue that privatization of public services (mail, transportation, healthcare) makes sense. In their belief private companies are <em>so much more efficient</em> that they&#8217;ll be able to provide the same or even better quality of service <em>and generate profit</em> for their owners while costing less than the public option. Now that is not the world we live in. Time and time again we have seen that private companies are not actually that much more efficient if at all and that profits come from lowering the working conditions and the quality of service or from raising prices.</p>



<p>All that will not surprise anyone who&#8217;s ever been in contact with a bigger corporation: Bureaucracy for example isn&#8217;t just what stupid workers in the public sector do but it is one of the infrastructures enabling big, often distributed organizations to function and the different departments in a big company are often very much busy doing their own thing, fighting for resources internally and being mildly annoyed be the other departments. It&#8217;s how humans operate.</p>



<p>Now while the belief in the general efficiency of the private sector is mostly false the thinking has weaseled its way into places where it doesn&#8217;t belong: Politics.</p>



<p>How often have you seen the demand to &#8220;run the country like a business&#8221;? We are confronted with an avalanche of reports about inefficiencies and wastefulness and stories about how &#8220;this would never work if it were a private company&#8221;. Which might even be true at times. But does it matter, really? Is that the right framing?</p>



<p>Of course many people would agree to the statement that the state/the government however the setup is where you live should not waste its resources but use then efficiently and effectively. I don&#8217;t think anyone disagrees. Where I disagree is how high on the list of priorities that really is.</p>



<p>I do not think it&#8217;s the job of the public sector to be the most efficient. The job of the public sector is to provide the services and infrastructures that the public decided it wants and demands at a good quality. And if you look at those services you will always see more to them than there mere &#8220;product&#8221;.</p>



<p>Public transportation like trains are not just there as another mere mode of getting people and goods from a to b. Offering a good alternative to car travel is important environmentally. Offering the service at reasonable (maybe not profitable) prices is important to provide access and participation for those with fewer resources. Just one example: If the trains were running for free think about how that would change the degree of freedom of families with low income and kids, how much easier it would be for those kids to experience freedom of exploration, opportunities to spend quality time with their family in engaging environments. This social benefit is immeasurable. </p>



<p>And you see these social and political side effects with every public infrastructure: They don&#8217;t just exist as a thing, they always serve multiple political and social values and are <em>built to serve them</em>. Uber talks a lot about offering people transportation but what they seek is profit, is getting a cut every time someone needs to move around. And that&#8217;s before we talk about how they only stay afloat by exploiting their drivers to the bone.</p>



<p>Neoliberalism has restructured not only our economic lives but the way we argue and talk. The framing of everything naturally being a market, that competition and optimization are always good and right is just not true. And it&#8217;s a dangerous framing to adapt.</p>



<p>Because it&#8217;s the lever to dismantle more and more of the social and political infrastructures we have and a roadblock to ensure we won&#8217;t build new ones. Which of course people trying to set up a rentier system everywhere like. But it&#8217;s not what the public sector is for.</p>



<p>We should measure the status of our public infrastructures and services by whether they work according to the political values we have, not whether they are merely efficient. A train system that&#8217;s been cut down to only the most profitable connections might be efficient but excludes people not in near the central hubs. A healthcare system that does not take care of good prevention and recovery might be more efficient on paper but will leave people without the care to ensure their long-term flourishing and quality of life.</p>



<p>Sure, I am not against public services running efficiently. <em>As long as</em> they provide their services in a way to maximize their impact on the well-being of everyone. Like: The German Bundestag, the parliament of one of the most wealthy countries in the world does not employ the people cleaning it but outsources that to some company who was in the news a few times for paying below minimum wage. How can that be?</p>



<p>It&#8217;s a consequence of &#8220;running the parliament efficiently&#8221;. Cut costs by outsourcing and not looking to closely. When as a democracy we should demand that the people who work <em>for all of us</em> &#8211; and that includes the people cleaning our parliament &#8211; get a fair and decent wage. Even if &#8220;the market&#8221; thinks they should be exploited more.</p>



<p>The late David Graeber <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@commietrashh/video/7217142049592691974">said it best:</a> &#8220;We&#8217;re all communists most of the time.&#8221; We know that most things in life shouldn&#8217;t be competitive but collaborative. We build most of our social lives around communities that do focus on well-being and care of its members. We know that by working together to build infrastructures for all, everyone&#8217;s life gets so much better. </p>



<p>We mustn&#8217;t forget that just to please the false god of &#8220;efficiency&#8221;.  </p>
