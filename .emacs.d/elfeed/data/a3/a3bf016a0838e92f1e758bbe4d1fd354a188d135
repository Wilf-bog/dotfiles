<p>I just published a new work on philosophy, which consists of a series of
imaginary stories.  Quoting from the introduction:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It is customary to associate fables with children.  Doing so in this
case would be presumptuous, for it would assume that (i) adults are
readily aware of the issues raised herein, and (ii) that imaginary
scenaria are didactic for kids in a way they are not for other age
groups.  Let us avoid such pitfalls.</p>

  <p>This is a work on philosophy.  The characters and events are imaginary,
though I could just as well write about actual stories that would still
convey the same ideas you are about to read.  What matters is the set of
insights one can draw from each fable individually and from all of them
taken as a unit.</p>

  <p>You can read these chapters in any given order, though I have provided
for a loosely sequential progression that could help streamline their
teachings.</p>
</blockquote>
