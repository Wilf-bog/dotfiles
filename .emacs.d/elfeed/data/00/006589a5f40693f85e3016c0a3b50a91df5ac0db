<p>In this ~35 minute video I show the work I am doing to create zones
around the hill that is next to my hut. The goal is to have easy
access to some lemon trees I have planted as well as to be able to
cultivate the grapevines that are now appearing in the spots I have
cleared. This zone is next to the stairs I did a few weeks ago.</p>
