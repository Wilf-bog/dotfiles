<p>Here are the highlights for the past two weeks:</p>
<p>Dorota <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gnome-control-center/-/merge_requests/2485">created a standalone dialog in GNOME Control Center</a> to let users choose/approve/reject when an app requests a Global Shortcuts</p>
<p>Dhanuka landed <a href="https://github.com/bilelmoussaoui/oo7/pull/77">Add rekeying support for oo7::portal::Keyring</a> in oo7.</p>
<p>Hub <a href="https://github.com/hfiguiere/ashpd/tree/usb-portal">implemented the in-progress USB portal in ashpd</a> to demo and test</p>
<p>Sophie landed <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/sophie-h/glycin/-/merge_requests/68">libglycin: Add C/glib/gir API for glycin crate</a>. This will let language bindings use Glycin. A first version of the C-API is for glycin is available <a href="https://sophie-h.pages.gitlab.gnome.org/glycin/c-api/">https://sophie-h.pages.gitlab.gnome.org/glycin/c-api/</a>.

<p>After two years of development, I&rsquo;m glad to announce that Apostrophe 3.0 is here! Almost every aspect of the application has seen improvements, from the obvious ones like the port to GTK4 and the refined interface, to several improvements under the hood. Among the new features are:</p>
<ul>
<li>A new toolbar so you don&rsquo;t have to remember markdown syntax</li>
<li>A more secure approach when opening and rendering files</li>
<li>Autoindentation and autocompletion for lists and braces</li>

<p>The <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/gstreamer/gst-plugins-rs/-/tree/main/video/gtk4">GStreamer GTK4 video sink</a> got <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/gstreamer/gst-plugins-rs/-/merge_requests/1547">support</a> for directly importing video frames as dmabufs on Linux when using GStreamer 1.24 / GTK 4.14, in addition to the already existing support for importing OpenGL textures or video frames in normal system memory. This new feature is available in version 0.12.4 of the sink plugin.</p>
<p>This is especially useful for video players using hardware decoders or applications that display a video stream from a camera (via v4l2 or pipewire), and allows side-stepping the GL/Vulkan rendering of the video frames inside GTK under certain conditions and let the composition be done by the Wayland compositor or even directly pass the dmabufs to the GPU kernel driver. Doing so would reduce GPU utilization and by that frees resources for other tasks and reduces power consumption. See <a href="https://blog.gtk.org/2024/04/17/graphics-offload-revisited/">Matthias' blog post</a> on the GTK blog for more details about the dmabuf and graphics offloading support in GTK.</p>

Opening up the log for, i.e. the gnome-shell repo, will now only take some seconds, if &ldquo;Show all branches&rdquo; is checked it will take roughly 15 seconds. Before it took roughly 1 minute 40 seconds, depending on your hardware of course.</p>
<p>There is now also a merge dialog available to merge a branch or commit into the current head. It is also possible to start a merge directly from the log context menu.</p>
<p>For easier usage, a help output has been added to both the turtle_cli and the turtlevcs python package, a bash completion file has been added and an emblem dialog has been added to the settings dialog.</p>

<p>Here comes <del>the bride</del> Fractal 7, with extended encryption support and improved accessibility. Server-side key backup and account recovery have been added, bringing greater security. Third-party verification has received some bug fixes and improvements. Amongst the many accessibility improvements, navigability has increased, especially in the room history. But that’s not all we’ve been up to in the past three months:</p>
<ul>
<li>Messages that failed to send can now be retried or discarded.</li>
<li>Messages can be reported to server admins for moderation.</li>
<li>Room details are now considered complete, with the addition of room address management, permissions, and room upgrade.</li>
<li>A new member menu appears when clicking on an avatar in the room history. It offers a quick way to do many actions related to that person, including opening a direct chat with them and moderating them.</li>
<li>Pills are clickable and allow to directly go to a room or member profile.</li>
</ul>
<p>As usual, this release includes other improvements, fixes and new translations thanks to all our contributors, and our upstream projects.</p>
<p>We want to address special thanks to the translators who worked on this version. We know this is a huge undertaking and have a deep appreciation for what you’ve done. If you want to help with this effort, head over to <a href="https://l10n.gnome.org/">Damned Lies</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/sophie-h/glycin">Glycin</a> is gaining support for other programming languages. Glycin is a library that features sandboxed and extendable image loading and is used by Image Viewer. It is written in Rust and so far only provided a <a href="https://docs.rs/glycin/latest/glycin/">Rust API</a>. As part of my work for GNOME STF, it has now gained initial support for being used with other languages. The basis for this is <a href="https://sophie-h.pages.gitlab.gnome.org/glycin/c-api/">the C-API</a>. Via <a href="https://developer.gnome.org/documentation/guidelines/programming/introspection.html">GObject introspections</a> it is now also usable with GJS, Python, and Vala (untested).</p>
<p>The advantages of Glycin over the well-proven GdkPixbuf are improved security, more reliable and dynamically adjusted memory usage limits, and reliable termination of loading processes. Currently, the drawbacks include a slightly increased overhead and missing support for anything but Linux.</p>
