</h1><p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@sophieherold:gnome.org">Sophie</a> announces</p>
<blockquote>
<p>GNOME Circle got a larger update on its app criteria and review procedures. We now have a more detailed and updated <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/Teams/Releng/AppOrganization/-/blob/main/AppCriteria.md">checklist</a> that also allows maintainers to check their apps before submitting them to GNOME Circle.</p>
<p>In the about two years of existence of the GNOME Circle initiative, the review process developed more and more into a cooperative process of maintainers, reviewers, and the broader community working together to get good apps into a awesome shape for joining the GNOME Circle. We hope that the new procedures will help us in continuing this process.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@sophieherold:gnome.org">Sophie</a> says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We finally made a public Matrix channel for GNOME Circle available under <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#circle:gnome.org">#circle:gnome.org</a>. The channel will receive sporadic <code>@room</code> notifications for important updates and changes within Circle. But it is also open to general questions and discussions about GNOME Circle. All GNOME Circle maintainers are asked to join the room to receive the notifications.</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@theevilskeleton:fedora.im">Hari Rana (TheEvilSkeleton)</a> announces</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Bottles 2022.8.28 was released!</p>
<p>We are introducing Library Mode. Library Mode is a new way to access programs installed in your bottles.</p>
<p>At first your library will appear empty. Open a bottle and choose the program you want. Then, from the context menu, press “Add to My Library” to add the game in the library. Covers are automatically identified and downloaded from <a href="https://www.steamgriddb.com/">SteamGridDB</a>. We are still working on the ability to add covers manually.</p>
<p>The Legacy Tools section has been re-organized with more specific and intuitive names, eliminating the noise that more advanced users (who this section is aimed at) might have encountered.</p>
<p>There are many other changes and improvements in this release. Below are some noteworthy ones, for all others, please refer to the <a href="https://github.com/bottlesdevs">GitHub organization</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Library mode is now a stable feature and enabled by default</li>
<li>Dependencies “copy_file” action now creates the path if not exists (see maintainers docs.)</li>
<li>Opening a bottle, a dialog is shown if the runner is not installed</li>
<li>The C: drive is now marked as persistend in the Drives section and cannot be edited by the user</li>
<li>All dialogs can now be closed pressing Escape</li>
<li>The dark mode switcher is now available only for system which doesn’t support the standard</li>
<li>Simplification of “Legacy Tools” section, thanks to @Knebergish</li>
<li>Minor UI improvements, thanks to @TheEvilSkeleton, @orowith2os, @marhkb</li>
<li>Fix a bug in the template system, was trying to unpack a partial one</li>
<li>Fix a bug in setting overrides for old-structured program entries</li>
<li>Fix a bug in vmtouch management</li>
<li>Fix a bug in the WineCommand interface which was causing a crash if the executable path is not accessible</li>
<li>Fix a bug in the Steam Manager, was generating wrong shortcuts when the program name has spaces in it</li>
<li>Fix long names in library mode</li>
<li>Fix a bug in bottle creation, sometimes it created a symlinks loop in the userdir</li>
<li>Fix a bug in the crash dialog, the similarity check was set too high resulting in no similar reports
