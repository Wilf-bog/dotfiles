<p>I just published a book about free/libre software.  This is a full guide
to reproducing my custom desktop session (my dotfiles) on Debian 10
‘buster’.</p>

<p>As noted in the book, the period prior to the official release of Debian
10 is considered a “beta” phase and is only meant to be used by testers
or early adopters.  PDFD will exit beta once ‘buster’ is out (expected
in the summer of 2019)—at which point I will make the necessary
adjustments to the book’s contents.</p>
