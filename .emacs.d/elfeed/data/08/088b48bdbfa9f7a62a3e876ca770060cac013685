<p>This is another video of mine where I do philosophy.  There is no
transcript.  The part with the waterfall of Chantara at the Troodos
mountain range (Cyprus) starts after the 15:00 mark.  I noticed that
whenever I toggled between the front and rear cameras, there was an
interruption or distortion to the audio.  I think nothing critical is
lost, though I will try to find ways to improve this while still
keeping it recording in one go.</p>

<p>Some of the other videos of mine that I mention here:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://protesilaos.com/books/2022-10-07-meditation-walking-acceptance/">On meditation, walking, and acceptance</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://protesilaos.com/books/2022-10-09-self-importance-elitism/">On self-importance and elitism</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://protesilaos.com/books/2022-10-13-practicality-honesty-patience/">Practicality, honesty, and patience</a></li>
</ul>

<p>The main points I covered:</p>

<ul>
  <li>There is a distinction between showing off and demonstrating
something, but in practice it is hard to draw clear lines.</li>
  <li>I am an Internet stranger to you (and you to me), which means that
you have no means of verifying my claims.  This adds to the problem
with the unclear lines.</li>
  <li>In turn, I cannot control how you perceive of what I consider
“demonstration”—you may still think it is me “showing off”.</li>
  <li>Explanation of the perils of overthinking.  Life is practical, not
theoretical.</li>
  <li>My corpus of work—such as this video of me walking and
talking—is a demonstration against overthinking.  It proves that I
managed to overcome a major problem I had.</li>
</ul>
