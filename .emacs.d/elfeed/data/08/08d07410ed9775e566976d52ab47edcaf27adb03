<blockquote>
<p>This week Dan Yeaw  released Gaphor 2.19.1. The simple modeling tool has received a lot of small improvements and bug fixes. Parts of the UI have been updated to use new GTK 4 elements. Information Flow for Associations has been added, and Object Flows can now connect to Join/Fork Nodes.

<blockquote>
<p>After months of work, Cartridges 2.0 is finally here.</p>
<p>Two new import sources have been added: Legendary and Flatpak.</p>
<p>Alongside several UX improvements, the import backed has been completely rewritten, huge thanks to <a href="https://github.com/GeoffreyCoulaud/">Geoffrey Coulaud</a>. This allows for faster imports, much better error handling and makes adding new sources much easier, so a lot more are coming soon!</p>

<p>This week I released Luminance, an app that lets you change brightness of displays including external ones that support DDC/CI (almost all non ancient displays support it). The app is intentionally really simple, and integrates very well with GNOME desktop. It also has a CLI interface for adjusting brightness from scripts or keyboard shortcuts, its available to install for Arch based distros in AUR and deb and rpm packages are available on GitHub releases. Would be looking at porting to GTK4 next, would have loved to make it available as a Flatpak but don&rsquo;t think that would be possible due to the app needing permissions to access i2c and backlight devices.

<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/World/Phosh/phosh">Phosh</a> 0.29.0 is out. This release adds improved audio device selection and notifications for ongoing calls. When phosh has information about a device&rsquo;s notches it can avoid placing UI elements there and you can enable suspend from the system menu. Notifications can now take more screen space on the lockscreen and we made a bunch of robustness fixes to the emergency info preferences plugin.

<blockquote>
<p>This week I released <a href="https://github.com/bragefuglseth/fretboard">Fretboard</a>, an app that lets you find guitar chords by typing their names or plotting them on an interactive guitar neck. No matter if you are a beginner or an advanced guitarist, you can use Fretboard to practice, learn, and master your favorite songs!</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d appreciate your help with improving the chord data. Please report any weird chord recommendations in the issue tracker, and I&rsquo;ll have a look at it.</p>
<p>Install Fretboard from <a href="https://flathub.org/apps/dev.bragefuglseth.Fretboard">Flathub</a> and give it a spin!

<p>This was a short week because of the holiday, but there still was a lot going on. With GUADEC coming soon at the end of the month, the staff is working towards making sure everything happens as smoothly as possible. If you haven&rsquo;t signed up for the Latvia social trip yet, there are still some spots open: <a href="https://events.gnome.org/event/101/page/164-northern-latvia-trip">https://events.gnome.org/event/101/page/164-northern-latvia-trip</a>. I am very much looking forward to that!</p>
<p>I spent a lot of this week catching up on lots of minutiae. There has been an emphasis on taxes and books this past month, as we have been onboarding our bookkeeper and working towards filing our taxes. I also renewed our mailbox, went over our foundation insurance policies, did state-mandated training, etc. In between that, I had meetings on the Executive Director search, travel issues, and finances, along with individual meetings with staff.</p>
<p>I am also getting ready to attend FOSSY next week where I will be giving a talk on creating crosswords with free software. GNOME will also be running a booth there, so please drop on by and say hi if you are going to be in Portland!</p>
