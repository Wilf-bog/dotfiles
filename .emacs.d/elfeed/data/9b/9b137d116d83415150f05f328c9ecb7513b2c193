<p>Ear Tag <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/World/eartag/-/releases/0.6.1">0.6.1</a> has been released, bringing a few minor quality-of-life improvements and a switch to the new AdwDialog widgets.

<p>(Sidenote - I am looking for contributors who would be willing to help with Ear Tag&rsquo;s testing, bug-fixing and further development, with the goal of potentially finding co-maintainers - if you&rsquo;re interested, see <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/World/eartag/-/issues/132">issue #132</a> for more details.)

<blockquote>
<p>A new minor release of <a href="https://flathub.org/apps/io.gitlab.gregorni.Letterpress">Letterpress</a> is out! No big UI changes in this 2.1 release, mostly small touches here and there:</p>
<ul>
<li>Images can now be pasted from the clipboard</li>
<li>Zoom is now more consistent between different factors</li>
<li>The Drag-n-Drop overlay was <del>stolen from Loupe</del> redesigned</li>
<li>The GNOME runtime was updated to version 46, which means the Tips Dialog now uses the new <a href="https://gnome.pages.gitlab.gnome.org/libadwaita/doc/main/class.Dialog.html"><code>Adw.Dialog</code></a>, and the About Dialog is now truly an <a href="https://gnome.pages.gitlab.gnome.org/libadwaita/doc/main/class.AboutDialog.html"><code>About Dialog</code></a></li>
</ul>
<p>The app has also been translated to Simplified Chinese!</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m happy to announce that, in the meantime, @FineFindus has joined the project as maintainer, so it&rsquo;s no longer maintained by a single person.</p>

<p><strong>Planify 4.7.2 is here!</strong></p>
<p>We&rsquo;re excited to announce the release of Planify version 4.7.2, with exciting new features and improvements to help you manage your tasks and projects even more efficiently!</p>
<p><strong>1. Inbox as Independent Project:</strong> We&rsquo;ve completely rebuilt the functionality of Inbox. Now, it&rsquo;s an independent project with the ability to move your tasks between different synchronized services. The Inbox is the default place to add new tasks, allowing you to quickly get your ideas out of your head and then plan them when you&rsquo;re ready.</p>
<p><strong>2. Enhanced Task Duplication:</strong> When you duplicate a task now, all subtasks and labels are automatically duplicated, saving you time and effort in managing your projects.</p>
<p><strong>3. Duplication of Sections and Projects:</strong> You can now easily duplicate entire sections and projects, making it easier to create new projects based on existing structures.</p>
<p><strong>4. Improvements in Quick Add:</strong> We&rsquo;ve improved the usability of Quick Add. Now, the &ldquo;Create More&rdquo; option is directly displayed in the user interface, making it easier to visualize and configure your new tasks.</p>
<p><strong>5. Improvements on Small Screens:</strong> For those working on devices with small screens, we&rsquo;ve enhanced the user experience to ensure smooth and efficient navigation.</p>
<p><strong>6. Project Expiry Date:</strong> Your project&rsquo;s expiry date now clearly shows the remaining days, helping you keep track of your deadlines more effectively.</p>
<p><strong>7. Enhanced Tag Panel:</strong> The tag panel now shows the number of tasks associated with each tag, rather than just the number of tags, giving you a clearer view of your tagged tasks.</p>
<p><strong>8. Archiving of Projects and Sections:</strong> You can now archive entire projects and sections! This feature helps you keep your workspace organized and clutter-free.</p>
<p><strong>9. New Task Preferences View and Task Details Sidebar:</strong> Introducing a new task preferences view! You can now customize your task preferences with ease. Additionally, we&rsquo;ve enabled the option to view task details using the new sidebar view, providing quick access to all the information you need.</p>
<p><strong>10. Translation Updates:</strong> We thank @Scrambled777 for the Hindi translation update and @twlvnn for the Bulgarian translation update.</p>
<p>These are just some of the new features and improvements you&rsquo;ll find in Planify version 4.7.2. We hope you enjoy using these new tools to make your task and project management even more efficient and productive.</p>
<p>Download the <a href="https://flathub.org/apps/io.github.alainm23.planify">update</a> today and take your productivity to the next level with Planify!</p>
<p>Thank you for being part of the Planify community!

<p><a href="https://github.com/MateusRodCosta/bign-handheld-thumbnailer">bign-handheld-thumbnailer</a> (a Nintendo DS and 3DS files thumbnailer) version 0.9.0 was intended to appear on previous week&rsquo;s TWIG but due to performance issues had to be postponed.</p>
<p>Version 0.9.0 is notable because it finally introduced CXI and CCI (which were deemed too hard to implement for the original 0.1.0 code) and there were a few misc improvements. However it was pointed that the thumbnailer was loading full games to the memory (official 3DS games can weight up to almost 4 GB) even though there were some suggestions on how to improve that I still failed to initiallly make it work.
At that point <a href="https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/mateusrodcosta/bign-handheld-thumbnailer/">a COPR repo</a> also became available to help distributed the compiled RPM.</p>
<p>Version 1.0.0 was intended to fix the performance issue once for all, but for more details I recommend reading the blog post about this release at my personal blog: <a href="https://www.mateusrodcosta.dev/blog/bign-handheld-thumbnailer-what-i-learned-linux-thumbnailer-rust/">https://www.mateusrodcosta.dev/blog/bign-handheld-thumbnailer-what-i-learned-linux-thumbnailer-rust/</a>
