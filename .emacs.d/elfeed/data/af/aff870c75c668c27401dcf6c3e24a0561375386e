<p>Recently port of the Vala Reference Manual was merged and is now accessible online <a href="https://gnome.pages.gitlab.gnome.org/vala/manual/index.html">here</a>. This was a longstanding effort to move away from a wiki-based solution. If you want to contribute to it now, you need to create a merge request in the Vala repository. Also it looks just so much more beautiful, doesn&rsquo;t it? ;)

<p>After more than 10 years, GLib is now <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/glib/-/merge_requests/3636">generating the introspection data</a> for its API instead of making it the responsibility of gobject-introspection. This is a requested step towards <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/glib/-/issues/3037">changing the documentation generator</a> for the GLib API references from gtk-doc to gi-docgen. Work is ongoing to <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/glib/-/merge_requests/3642">move libgirepository into GLib</a>, as part of the overall goal of <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/glib/-/issues/2616">simplifying the introspection build</a>.

<p>In our ongoing efforts to organize the GNOME pages a bit better, we have created a <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/Teams/Websites">Websites Team</a>. The Websites Team is currently a loose association of people maintaining websites within the GNOME project. In this context, a bunch of website repositories have already been moved to the <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/Teams/Websites">new GitLab team</a>.

<p>I&rsquo;ve extended the chapter &ldquo;The Main Event Loop&rdquo; of the gtk-rs book to include more information on how to deal with <code>async</code> code.
It shows how to:</p>
<ul>
<li>embed blocking calls in an async context,</li>
<li>run async functions from external crates, and</li>
<li>integrate with tokio.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thanks goes to Fina, Sabrina and Bilal Elmoussaoui for reviewing the changes.</p>

<p>Tagger <a href="https://github.com/NickvisionApps/Tagger/releases/tag/2023.10.0">V2023.10.0</a> is here! We&rsquo;ve been hard at work this month bringing you a release packed with features and fixes :)</p>
<p>First, this release introduces a brand-new Windows version of the app built on WindowsAppSDK and WinUI 3! For all those unfortunately stuck using Windows at times, they can now use this great app on their system with a 1:1 feature match with the GNOME version!</p>
<p>In terms of features, this release introduces full support for playlists with relative paths, new tag properties, and a new information dialog for album art. Tagger will also watch a music folder library for changes on disk and prompt the user to reload the folder within the app. Furthermore, we fixed many issues and tweaked the design of some aspects of the app in which you can read all about below!</p>
<p>A special thanks to @kissthermite for bringing most of the changes in this release to our attention :)</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the full changelog:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tagger is now available for Windows using Windows App SDK and WinUI 3</li>
<li>Added the option to use relative paths when creating a playlist. This means that Tagger also now supports opening playlists with relative paths</li>
<li>Added the Disc Number, Disc Total, and Publishing Date fields to additional properties</li>
<li>Added information dialog for album art</li>
<li>Added an option in Preferences to limit file name characters to those only supported by Windows</li>
<li>Tagger will now watch a music folder library for changes on disk and prompt the user to reload if necessary</li>
<li>Tagger will now display front album art within a music file row itself if available</li>
<li>Tagger will now remember previously used format strings for file name to tag and tag to file name conversions</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where downloaded lyrics would sometimes contain html encoded characters</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where file names containing the <code>&lt;</code> character caused the music file row to not display</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where the duration displayed for multiple selected files was wrong</li>
<li>Improved create playlist dialog ux</li>
<li>Updated translations (Thanks everyone on Weblate!)

<li>Version 4 also brings the rename from &ldquo;Login Manager Settings&rdquo; to &ldquo;GDM Settings&rdquo;. Internally, GDM Settings has always been known as gdm-settings. So, the rename should makes things clearer and more consistent.</li>
