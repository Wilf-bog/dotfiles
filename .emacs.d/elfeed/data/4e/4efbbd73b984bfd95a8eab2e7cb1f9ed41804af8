</p>
<p>This Week in GNOME is dedicated to the struggles of all lesbian, gay, trans, inter, bi, pan, asexual, aromantic, non-binary, and queer people.</p>
<p>LGBTQIA+ people have always been an integral part of our project, across all different roles. We wish to take this opportunity to thank you all from the bottom of our hearts for all your contributions to GNOME and to our community as whole.</p>
<p>We as a project have a fundamental responsibility to ensure the safety and well-being of everyone in our community. This can only be accomplished by prioritizing marginalized people’s safety over privileged people’s comfort. To accomplish this we expect everyone to follow our <a href="https://conduct.gnome.org/">Code of Conduct</a>, we moderate our chat rooms via cross-community moderation lists and we believe in speaking up whenever something is not right. This takes a remarkable effort every single day, and we still have a lot to learn and to improve. Let us learn and grow together, to become the best we can be.</p>
<p>Our thoughts go out to all the people that have to fight for their right to exist. We stand with you and we fight with you.</p>

<p>More visible CVE reports for gnome-build-meta                                                                                                                                                                                                        Recently we have made a few changes to the generation and accessibility of CVE reports for gnome-build-meta.</p>
<p>These changes include the generation of additional CVE reports for both the vm and vm-secure manifests, for master and all future, supported release branches. We also make use of Gitlab Pages to automatically publish not only the CVE reports for the master branch, but also reports for each currently supported release branch. A list of these individual reports can be obtained through a newly added badge that can be found at the top of gnome-build-meta’s README.</p>
<p>This work was carried out as part of Codethink’s collaboration with the GNOME Foundation, through the Sovereign Tech Fund (STF).

<p>Showtime is slated to replace Totem, GNOME&rsquo;s current video app. The reason is that Totem has now been unmaintained for nearly a year and still uses GTK 3.</p>
<p>You can help improve Showtime by testing <a href="https://welcome.gnome.org/app/Showtime/#installing-a-nightly-build">the nightly version</a> and contributing. The incubation progress will be <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/Teams/Releng/AppOrganization/-/issues/29">tracked in this issue</a>.

</h3><p>Travel with all your train information in one place.</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@camelcasenick:matrix.org">Markus Göllnitz</a> says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We have some great news about Railway! @schmiddi:matrix.org has done a tremendous job at boring up the backend code of the application, as well as its library counterpart. Railway is no longer limited to the HAFAS API. 🎉 That is not just a theoretical improvement: As the first newly supported network, you can test the Swiss SBB through search.ch.</p>
<p>If you use Railway and want to test this new network, or want to help us make sure we did not introduce obscure regressions, be sure to test our Railway beta release on Flathub beta: <code>flatpak install https://flathub.org/beta-repo/appstream/de.schmidhuberj.DieBahn.flatpakref</code>. If you do test it: Thank You! And feel free to share feedback with us over at <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#railwayapp:matrix.org">#railwayapp:matrix.org</a> or <a href="https://gitlab.com/schmiddi-on-mobile/railway/-/issues">at our issue tracker</a>.</p>
<p>Aaaand … @schmiddi:matrix.org even went so far as to implement support for MOTIS. You never heard of that? It is used by an open data based routing project: the <a href="https://transitous.org/">Transitous</a> project. As they say about themselves, “Transitous is a community-run provider-neutral international public transport routing service.” If you hate the need to change the network in Railway, care about FLOSS server-side as much as client-side, and want to see open data in open formats, such as GTFS, excel, you will love this. In the beta release, you can find it as “Worldwide (beta) using Transitous,” but bear in mind that official providers are still more accurate, more up-to-date, and will stay for a reason. If you want to see that changed, you can get involved with said project.</p>

<p>I have released <a href="https://flathub.org/apps/io.github.nokse22.Exhibit">Exhibit</a>, an app to view 3D models, powered by <a href="https://f3d.app/">F3D</a>.</p>
<p>Some of the features are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Support for many file formats, including glTF, USD, STL, STEP, PLY, OBJ, FBX, Alembic and many more</li>
<li>Many rendering and visual settings</li>
<li>HDRI or colored background</li>
<li>Export render to image</li>
<li>Drag and drop files</li>
<li>It installs mimetype and icon for supported file types</li>
</ul>
<p>For now it only works with X11/Xwayland because the library can only be compiled to work with one compositor at a time.

<p><strong>Day Progress</strong>: an extension that shows a progress bar of your day to help you track your time.</p>
<p>I actually released this last week, but it took another week for it to become stable enough to call it a stable release. Here&rsquo;s how it works: you set the start and reset (end) times in the extension preferences (for example, the start and end of your workday) and it displays a progress bar of the current time in the top panel.</p>
<p>Features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Customisable start and end times, including the ability to wrap around midnight</li>
<li>Option to show time elapsed instead of remaining</li>
<li>Customisable bar width and height</li>
<li>Option to display a bar with smooth, curved ends (experimental)</li>
<li>Customisable panel position and index</li>
<li>Shows percentage and time elapsed and remaining in the tooltip (see image below)</li>

<p>My week has been very busy with financial things. I had meetings with our bookkeeper and our accountant. With their support, our books have never looked as good as they do now. In addition, working within our board-approved balanced budget has meant that our numbers look healthier as well. This point was made more apparent to me when our accountant asked if we had considered finding higher interest accounts for our funds. More research on this is now on my to-do list.</p>

Please submit using the link on that page. While we value all feedback, having it all in one place makes it easier for us to make sure we don&rsquo;t lose any of your views.</p>
