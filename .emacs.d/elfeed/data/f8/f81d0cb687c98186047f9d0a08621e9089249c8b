<p>Here is another philosophical talk I did while being outdoors.  You
need to load the video as there is no transcript.  It is about an hour
long.</p>

<p>The main points are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>I am not judgemental and do not issue edicts or rant about the state
of the world.  Everything I say is a suggestion; an appeal to your
reason.</li>
  <li>I am okay with video games.  There is nothing inherently wrong about
them.</li>
  <li>There exist problems which have to do with business practices.  We
have those in all industries.</li>
  <li>Whatever your hobbies or activities, try to find a balance in your
life.  It makes you more rounded and you can understand others
better.</li>
  <li>When we all try to keep an open mind, we have a more harmonious
society.  We communicate better and avoid the extremes.</li>
  <li>I am a regular person.  Try not to assume too many things about me
or anyone.  It helps with maintaining the right disposition and
being tolerant of the diversity of humans.</li>
</ul>
