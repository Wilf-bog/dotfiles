<p>I had no plan to make this video as I spend most of my time studying
in the hope of improving my chances at the labour market.  The reason
I decided to record this video presentation is because I received
three books as a gift from a person in China I correspond with.  One
of those books is <em>Dao De Jing</em> by Lao Zi.</p>

<p>I apply with my own philosophy and concepts to understand the first
statement of <em>Dao De Jing</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Dao that can be articulated is not the eternal Dao; the name
that can be named is not its eternal name.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The translator explains that “Dao” is interpreted in other cultures as
“God” and variants thereof and how Lao Zi uses it to mean the “Mother
of all”.</p>

<p>My points in brief:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Analysis of the Yin-Yang symbol.  Specifically, a comprehensive take
on how black and white are opposites but also how they can be
understood as the same.</li>
  <li>This analysis provides insight into what I call <em>the scope of
application</em>, namely how the given level of abstraction
substantiations the concepts/words.</li>
  <li>The scope of application makes us reason about—and always account
for—the way in which something is, else its <em>modality</em> (mode of
being) or <em>Tropos</em>.</li>
  <li>More analysis of Yin-Yang using the new concepts.</li>
  <li>From there we understand how Tropos has multiple strata; how there
exist many levels of abstraction in each of which there emerge
phenomena that are specific to the given level.  I call this the
<em>stratification of emergence</em>.</li>
  <li>Examples of the stratification of emergence, such as how happiness
and sadness are different at the stratum of the conscious person,
but are the same insofar as they both are biochemical phenomena.</li>
  <li>Explanation of the idea that concepts exhibit a triadic relations
between the instances and their greater abstraction.  By finding the
common in the multitude between two instances at a given level of
abstraction we arrive at the third magnitude, which is that which
they have in common.</li>
  <li>That which can be named is that which can be described and that
which can be described is that which has Tropos.</li>
  <li>The Dao, which I explain in the video as “Being”, is that which is
common to all, hence that which necessarily has no Tropos.  If it
has Tropos, then it is the same as all other presences that have
Tropos, insofar as they have Tropos.</li>
  <li>Long comment on Confucius’ famous quote whether Lao Zi is a dragon
(I mentioned the quote in the introduction and this long exposition
served to answer the question).  In short, no Lao Zi was a human to
whom we can relate.  His wisdom is not a secret because we can
understand it.  All sages are human and treating them as “dragons”,
as decisively alien, harms both us and them.</li>
</ul>
