<p>This is a much revised and updated version of an essay I first posted some ten years ago. In this essay (attached below) I introduce my concept of Homo sapiens as a <em>failed species</em> and my interpretation of humanity as a vast, sprawling <em>empire</em>, a dysfunctional and destructive totality &#8212; whatever its class or regional differences &#8212; that dominates all other species and earth&#8217;s interrelated ecosystems. The destructive and unsustainable nature of human existence has been manifest virtually since the dawn of Homo sapiens, some 100,000 years ago. Human numbers and impact have altered the planet to such an extent, humans have created <em>a new geological epoch</em> &#8212; commonly referred to as the &#8220;Anthropocene&#8221;&#8211; shattering the planetary stability of the last 12,000 years and ushering in a new epoch marked by the unfolding of the sixth mass extinction in earth history and catastrophic climate change. The furies of an earth now responding to the presence of a powerful and disruptive parasitic species are dramatically manifest in global warming, superstorms, mega-droughts, melting ice sheets, and rising sea-levels, as the planet moves to a state increasingly hostile to human survival. This essay is forthcoming in the <em>Romanian Journal of Artistic Creativity</em>, and will be further expanded in the form of a book that draws from anthropological studies, ecology, animal liberation, social theory, and philosophy. </p>
