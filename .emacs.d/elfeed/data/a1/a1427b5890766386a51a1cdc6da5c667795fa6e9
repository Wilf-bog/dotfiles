<p>Thanks to Dmitry Matveyev for the 500 EUR donation that allowed me to
buy the smartphone (Samsung A53) and selfie stick that I use to record
these videos in the great outdoors.</p>

<p>In this entry, I walked in the mountains and talked about developing
the right attitude for dealing with matters we do not control.  The
main points:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A story of mine about remaining open to new experiences after
misfortune strikes.</li>
  <li>You do not control all the factors.  If you assume the blame, you
imply that you do control those factors.</li>
  <li>If you think you are a god, you will always overestimate your
abilities.  You will then desire to achieve that which you cannot.
The disconnect will make you suffer.</li>
  <li>An explanation of non-ownership with specific examples.</li>
  <li>Elaboration on the bad habit of dithering, delaying, and postponing.
You think you control time, again overestimating yourself.</li>
  <li>Overthinking and overanalysing is to your detriment.  Fundamentally,
you make the mistake of assuming that the perfect is attainable.</li>
  <li>Thinking that the perfect is attainable means that you expect your
actions to be perfect.  But to act is to do so in imperfect
circumstances, with incomplete knowledge.</li>
  <li>To act is to perform a leap of faith.  There is faith in acting.</li>
  <li>More examples that tie it all together.</li>
</ul>
