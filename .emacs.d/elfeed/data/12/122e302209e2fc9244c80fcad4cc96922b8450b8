<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">protesilaos.com</code> now conforms with the web standard on system-wide
theme preferences (see
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/prefers-color-scheme">prefers-color-scheme</a>).
<strong>This is not a per-website option.  It does not require changes from
your side.</strong> It is just about respecting the user’s choice on using a
light/dark theme throughout their operating system.</p>

<p>Those who opt for a dark theme in their system settings will view this
website in dark colours.  Otherwise they will get the default, lighter
looks.  Either way, the presentation should conform with the highest
accessibility standard (WCAG AAA).</p>

<p>Several aspects of the website’s underlying code base have been
refactored.  If, despite my best intentions, you feel something is
amiss, please do <a href="https://protesilaos.com/contact/">contact me</a>.</p>
