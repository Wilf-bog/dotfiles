<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://gnome.pages.gitlab.gnome.org/libadwaita/doc/main/class.BottomSheet.html"><code>AdwBottomSheet</code></a> is now public, allowing apps to use bottom sheets outside dialogs. It also has an optional bottom bar, which may be useful for music player apps.

</h1><p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@pabloyoyoista:matrix.org">Pablo Correa Gomez</a> announces</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This week Papers, the Incubator app for viewing documents, had its first release published on <a href="https://flathub.org/apps/org.gnome.Papers">Flathub</a>! Now you can download a stable version instead of using GNOME nightly. We are hoping to get more testing and feedback from the community!</p>
<p>In the meanwhile, development continues at a high pace! Qiu Wenbo has continued porting many widgets to libadwaita, UI templates, and Rust, I have focused on cleanups, and as part of GSoC Markus GÃ¶llnitz has continued improving the UI! The top headerbar is now split in two, and search happens over the sidebar. Not only allows this to fit the UI in a phone size, but also provides better modularity, making the application more maintainable.

<p>Railway version 2.6.0 was now published. This release refactors a lot of the backend of Railway, such that we can now support many more providers. As a start, Railway now supports SBB and the <a href="https://transitous.org/">Transitous</a> project. Adding new providers should be an easy task if one is proficient with the Rust programming language and the provider has an easy API one can use. To help anybody to contribute their favourite provider, in the case it is not yet implemented, we have extensive documentation on <a href="https://gitlab.com/schmiddi-on-mobile/railway-backend/-/blob/main/docs/writing-a-provider.md?ref_type=heads">how to write such an implementation</a>. In case you want to help out, feel free to <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#railwayapp:matrix.org">write us a message</a>. Even though this was the biggest change with this release, it was not the only one. We improved the user experience in some parts of the application, for example you will now be informed about the option to delete old journeys to clean out these bookmarks automatically. We also made the application more accessible, with support for screen readers for searching for stations.</p>

<p>Please, if you have any ideas, contact me on Matrix! (Daknig on Matrix dot org). Even if you have no prior experience in GTK and are just meddling in Rust, I promise to help!</p>
<p>The situation with invidious being blocked is going to affect DewDuct, the future is uncertain; But, for now, enjoy the new released and see your bugs squashed!</p>

<p>Along with our friends at KDE e.V. and Eclipse Foundation, the GNOME Foundation was recently invited to become an Associate Member of the new <a href="https://matrix.org/about/">Matrix.org Foundation</a> to help provide feedback on making the platform more useful for communities like GNOME to collaborate on free software development.</p>
<p>Strengthening partnerships between free software communities like ours is an important aspect of project sustainability. We remain grateful to the Matrix.org Foundation for providing the <a href="https://handbook.gnome.org/get-in-touch/matrix.html">infrastructure used for GNOME&rsquo;s rooms and Foundation member accounts</a>.</p>
<p>As part of their recent Governing Board launch, I&rsquo;m pleased to share that <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/CleoMenezesJr">Cleo Menezes Jr.</a> has been appointed to be GNOME&rsquo;s first delegate to this group. Cleo will help advocate for GNOME in using and helping others use Matrix, so if you have any feedback or questions, <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@cleomenezesjr:matrix.org">get in touch</a>.</p>
