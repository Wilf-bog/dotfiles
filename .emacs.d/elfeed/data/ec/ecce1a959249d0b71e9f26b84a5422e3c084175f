my <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">modus-themes</code> for GNU Emacs.  Here is the announcement, which
includes my name in the list and a link to my project’s GitHub page:

<p>I am happy for this recognition and am especially thankful that it
pertains to the Modus themes.  I started this project with the intent
to improve the accessibility of Emacs.  The Modus themes are designed
in accordance with the highest standard for legibility (measured in
terms of colour contrast).  Though this description alone undervalues
the effort that goes into their design, as they are also attentive to
details, avoid exaggerations, account for colour harmonies, rely on
colour complementarity where necessary, are highly customisable,
support a broad range of Emacs packages, and come with comprehensive
documentation.  Furthermore, they have variants that are optimised for
people with deuteranopia or tritanopia (the latter is part of the
current development version).</p>

<p>I consider accessibility—and usability more broadly—integral to
the realisation of software freedom.  I elaborate at length here:

The gist is that I am not satisfied with having the right to use a
program freely.  I also want the program to help me do so, such as
with its interface or instruction material.</p>

<p>Thanks to the folks at Google for this award!  Recognising free
software is a step in the right direction.</p>
