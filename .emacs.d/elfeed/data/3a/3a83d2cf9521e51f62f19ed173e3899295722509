         <p>No work at home, no work for hut project, so I am doing a live stream
about my <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote</code> package.  I want to get into unit testing with the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ert</code> package that is built into Emacs.  <strong>The video will be recorded
and can be watched later.</strong></p>

<p>I have never written unit tests before.  I want to learn them as a
general skill, but also because I want <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote</code> to have comprehensive
tests in place before its next major release.</p>

<p>I understand I am announcing this without much prior notice (current
time 13:02 +0300).  No worries!</p>

<h2>About Denote</h2>

<p>Denote is a simple note-taking tool for Emacs.  It is based on the
idea that notes should follow a predictable and descriptive
file-naming scheme.  The file name must offer a clear indication of
what the note is about, without reference to any other metadata.
Denote basically streamlines the creation of such files while
providing facilities to link between them.</p>

<p>Denote’s file-naming scheme is not limited to “notes”.  It can be used
for all types of file, including those that are not editable in Emacs,
such as videos.  Naming files in a constistent way makes their
filtering and retrieval considerably easier.  Denote provides relevant
facilities to rename files, regardless of file type.</p>
