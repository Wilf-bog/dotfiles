<p>New Zealand-born singer Bradley Hanan Carter (known from NO, 5 Billion in Diamonds, and Steriogram) explains, “‘That Looks like a House&#8217; is for anyone who’s faced dating app mishaps or encountered the bizarre world of online personas.”</p>
<p>FAUX PRIX, California’s freshest indie collective (think Leonard Cohen meets Ableton), made a striking entrance into the music scene in May 2024 with their debut dream-hop anthem &#8216;Walking in the Rain,&#8217; taken from their upcoming LP.</p>

<p>The concept for FAUX PRIX originated in a tour van heading west near Marfa, TX, at the end of 2015. It evolved into a collective diary chronicling eight years of life, love, and experiences. This journey, primarily navigated by Carter, also features contributions from long-time friends and collaborators Michael Guy Chislett (NO, The Academy Is), Devon Lee (Races), Spike Philips, and Sean Daniel Stentz (both from Carter’s previous band NO).</p>
