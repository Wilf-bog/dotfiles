<hr />
<p>They recently unveil the single &#8216;Falling Behind,&#8217; accompanied by a stunning video directed and produced by CLUMP Collective.</p>
<p>The album&#8217;s release has been anticipated with the acclaimed singles &#8216;Bright Yellow&#8217; and &#8216;Killer.&#8217; The latest track, &#8216;Falling Behind,&#8217; offers another glimpse into &#8216;Open the Door,&#8217; showcasing Scantlebury at their best. The indie-rock track is both contemplative and confrontational—a firecracker that lingers in your mind long after its initial impact.</p>

<p>Scantlebury shares: &#8220;This song is full of frustration—at the world and at myself—for feeling like things should be different and I could do better.&#8221; Although the album title, &#8216;Open the Door,&#8217; suggests hope and welcome, it also reflects moments when doors have been shut in Scantlebury&#8217;s face. This sentiment is palpable in &#8216;Falling Behind&#8217;: “We&#8217;ll make it fair, you&#8217;ll be heard, you want respect and that&#8217;s what you deserve / But recently I&#8217;ve noticed all the things that I&#8217;ve been promised.”</p>

<p>The video, directed and produced by CLUMP Collective, complements the album art and follows the narrative of a relationship. It explores how initial apprehension or unease can transform into something positive and fulfilling. The video stars Scantlebury&#8217;s wife, Eleanor Crewes, portraying a green monster that could symbolize the &#8220;I,&#8221; the &#8220;you,&#8221; or something else entirely.</p>
