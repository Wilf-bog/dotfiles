<p>Another video presentation that I recorded while walking in nature.
You need to watch or listen to the video.  It is about an hour long.</p>

<p>This entry builds on my talk about <a href="https://protesilaos.com/books/2022-10-07-meditation-walking-acceptance/">meditation, walking, and
acceptance</a>.
Though it is no necessary to watch that as well.</p>
