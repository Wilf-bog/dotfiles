<p>For today’s entry, I have picked music from the island of Crete.  It
seems to me that the Cretans have some special connection with the
Muses.  More so the Xylouris family whose members appear to all be
talented musicians (e.g see my <a href="https://protesilaos.com/interpretations/2022-06-30-psarantonis-tigri/">Interpretation of “Tiger” by
Psarantonis</a>).</p>

<p>The song is titled <em>The pain of Heracles</em> (Ο πόνος του Ηρακλή) with
music and lyrics by Labis Xylouris (Λάμπης Ξυλούρης):

<p>Below are the lyrics, my translation of them, and some further
philosophical comments.</p>

Αν είναι πέτρα τηνε σπώ
Σίδερο το λυγίζω
Μα την παντέρμη αμοναξιά
δεν τηνε νταγιαντίζω

If it is stone I break it
Iron I bend it
But the ever-solitary loneliness
I cannot endure

<p>Heracles (Ηρακλής) is the indomitable hero of myth who is known for his
peerless strength and self-discipline.  Heracles is a demigod, endowed
with talents that no human possesses.  Yet the poet reminds us that even
a being of such a sort is still not a god.  Therein lies the insight
that the seemingly invincible Heracles is, in fact, movable, fragile,
breakable, <em>human</em>.</p>

<p>Our greatest weakness is our own narrative of selfhood.  We sometimes
make the mistake of believing in our own story, taking it too seriously,
and confirming in our mind how we are, indeed, special.</p>

<p>One is healthy, energetic, and enjoys a life of plenty.  Those comforts
create the illusion of permanence, of safety everlasting.  This,
however, is the human who has deluded themselves into thinking they have
transcended the boundaries of being human.  None of those comforts are
inherent to the human condition.  They can all be taken away, leaving
the being in its true state: exposed.</p>

<p>Heracles is breakable because all humans are.  Even a half-god cannot
escape from this reality.  He can employ his strength to do unthinkable
deeds, yet he cannot be immovable in the way the mountains in the
video’s background are.  Only the mountain does not flinch in the face
of hardship.  Humans can only work towards becoming less weak, less
prone to self-deception.  They shall never undo their humanity.</p>

<p>In my correspondence with people, I often use phrases such as “no
worries” and “take it easy”.  These are no mere figures of speech.  I
mean those words.  Perhaps I should be more direct: “remember you are
human”.  Do not pretend to be tough.  You are not.  Do not pretend to be
immovable.  You are not.</p>

<p>Just stop pretending about your nature.  Though not because I have some
weird penchant for honesty.  No.  We are too nice and pretentious
towards each other—I know how it works as I have done it countless
times myself: masking my weakness, hiding behind a facade of happiness,
saying that it is alright when it isn’t.</p>

<p>Don’t bother telling me the truth of your actuality.  I know how to read
people, anyway.  A fraud can figure out another fraud given sufficient
information.</p>

<p>Simply stop telling lies to yourself.  Keep your self grounded in your
reality.  Whatever you think you have is not yours.  Perhaps, then, you
will be less fragile.</p>

<p>Now close your eyes and let the Muse take you to those mountaintops.</p>
