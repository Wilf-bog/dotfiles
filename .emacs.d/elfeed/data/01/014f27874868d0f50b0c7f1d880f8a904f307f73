<p>I just created a new section on my website, which contains my
translations of—and comments on—works of art, typically Greek
songs.: <a href="https://protesilaos.com/interpretations">https://protesilaos.com/interpretations</a>.  It also has a
<a href="https://protesilaos.com/interpretations.xml">dedicated RSS feed</a>.</p>

<p>The first publication is a comment on a wonderful song: <a href="https://protesilaos.com/interpretations/2022-06-28-alkinoos-mirror/">Interpretation
of Alkinoos Ioannides’ “Kathreftis”
(Mirror)</a>.
Expect more to follow (maybe even later today).</p>
