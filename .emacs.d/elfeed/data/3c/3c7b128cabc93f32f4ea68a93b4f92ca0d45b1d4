You could like animals, you could date animals, even have one as a life partner, but that was just part of your existence, free from any labels. Labels are heavy things, and they come with a lot of baggage that you might not always want. If you just so happened to really really like your dog, you were just you and also you liked a dog. There was simplicity in that. It wasn't complicated, nor did you have to really worry about anything past that. Obviously you still had to be careful, there's always been people that didn't approve of human animal relationships. But at the same time, most people didn't care.

Let's make the queer comparison here. Say that you're a trans person. What that literally means is that your gender doesn't fit the sex that your body happens to have. But when you picture a trans person, even if you yourself reading this are trans, there's a few more traits that you probably associate with the label. They're probably someone who's very left leaning politically. They're more likely younger than older. They're probably not somebody you'd assume is into guns or hunting or the military. They're probably a big fan of Fallout: New Vegas. None of those things are </span><span class="author-a-z122zz74z3a5lxz81zp5z65z6wgz67zp">integral</span><span class="author-a-qz85zz83z4z76zz81zz68zz89zkz82z3z76zz72zsz71zt"> to the trans experience at the end of the day, but it's the label. So if you're a trans person that prefers Fallout 2, loves shooting deer, and is really excited to vote Trump, you probably feel alienated by the trans label, even if you also are the wrong gender for your sex. </span></div>

More artists, more podcasts, more music. For whatever reason, the zoo community is absolutely filled with incredible musicians. And those new people creating content in the community is going to then inflate numbers more and more.

The zoo community is like that. We're small right now, so we can have a few people pedaling all out to keep us going, but the larger the community gets and the more pressure put on us, the heavier the cart becomes. Every single person has the ability to help pedal, and the more people that do, the faster we go. But the reality is, not everyone is going to want to put in that effort. And honestly, the thing that scares me the most is that eventually we lose steam and stop moving altogether, buried under our own weight.</span><span class="author-a-z122zz74z3a5lxz81zp5z65z6wgz67zp"> I don't predict that that will happen. I do see a lot of talent and drive in the community, and to an extent, I think this vehicle almost can't help but propel itself forward at this point. But, there's the "maybe," the possibility of what else happens, if I'm wrong about what kind of positive future awaits us in the distance.</span><span class="author-a-iz66zjfz90z3z77z8yz81ziz71zb7z80zi"> </span></div>
