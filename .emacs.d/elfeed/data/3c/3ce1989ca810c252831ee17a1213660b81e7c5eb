<p>Capitalism has created regular economic crises, distorted the worldâ€™s development and created a handful of rich countries and a majority of poorer, super-exploited countries.</p>



<p>The rich countries are the base for most of the giant global corporations that monopolise key sectors of the economy. Their governments maintain powerful militaries to protect their economic hegemony.</p>



<p>The rich countries have launched a new arms race that risks escalating into nuclear war and drains public funds that should be used to address the climate emergency and pressing social needs.</p>



<p>Faced with these threats, building political movements and alliances that are powerful enough to challenge the power of fossil fuel capital is urgent.</p>



<p>The shift away from a market-based economic system to a needs based economy with people and nature at its centre can only be done if critical industries such as energy, transport, agribusiness and the financial institutions that invest in them are brought under popular control.</p>
