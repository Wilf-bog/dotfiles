<p>Jon M Sterling, a computer scientist at Cambridge University, has created his own &lsquo;<a href="https://www.jonmsterling.com/index.xml">mathematical Zettelkasten</a>&rsquo;, which he also calls &lsquo;a forest of evergreen notes&rsquo;.</p>
<p>He maintains a very interesting <a href="https://www.jonmsterling.com/index.xml">website</a>, built using a tool he created, named, appropriately enough, <a href="https://www.jonmsterling.com/jms-005P.xml">Forester</a>.</p>

<p>The implementation of his ideas raises all sorts of ideas and questions for me, almost all enthusiastic. Here are a few in no order at all:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://notes.andymatuschak.org/About_these_notes?stackedNotes=z5E5QawiXCMbtNtupvxeoEX">Andy Matuschak</a> coined the term &lsquo;evergreen notes&rsquo;, which Jon Sterling has further developed with great elegance. The original concept, I think, comes from journalism&rsquo;s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evergreen_(media)">&lsquo;evergreen content&rsquo;</a>, an item that’s endlessly relevant, which can be created in advance and only used on a slow-news day. It has been adopted by content marketers as a kind of <a href="https://ahrefs.com/blog/evergreen-content/">holy grail of online writing</a>. Why write about yesterday’s sports results (ephemeral) when you can write about how to cook a meatloaf (evergreen) and get better SEO? This is a quite a bit different from Jon Sterling&rsquo;s apparent intention, where the academic workflow involves producing papers, lectures, presentations and so on,from the same or similar units of information, and the interchangeability of the publishing format matters. I wonder whether there&rsquo;s a tension between the &lsquo;evergreen&rsquo; quality of the <em>contents</em> of the note (i.e. an idea that can be applied in several different contexts) and the <em>format</em> of the note (i.e. a textual artefact that can be re-mixed and re-published). In any case, Prof. Sterling seems to be on the way to resolving it.</li>
<li>Forester uses a unique ID for each note, which is an author’s three-letter initials followed by a unique <a href="https://www.jonmsterling.com/jms-0074.xml">four digit base 36 number</a> (i.e. a number where the permitted numerals are <code>0123456789ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ</code>). I like this, a lot. With just four digits you can identify 1,679,616 unique notes - far more than you&rsquo;re likely to be generating.</li>
<li>There are some stimulating thoughts on <a href="https://www.jonmsterling.com/tfmt-0005.xml">the role of hierarchy in notes</a>, which I’ve also been <a href="https://writingslowly.com/2024/01/29/does-the-zettelkasten.html">thinking</a> <a href="https://writingslowly.com/2023/08/11/a-network-of.html">about</a>.</li>
<li>Sterling is keen on <a href="https://www.jonmsterling.com/tfmt-0007.xml">atomicity</a>. Me too. Very keen, because <a href="https://writingslowly.com/2024/02/11/from-fragments-you.html">from fragments you can build a greater whole</a>.</li>
<li>Is this a Zettelkasten or a public Wiki? Hmm, not sure. Arguably, a Wiki needs to be using wiki software, whereas a Zettelkasten is rather a method or process, which numerous tools could create. But whatever it is, it does make me think there’s a clear fourfold typology here: <em>single-author</em> or <em>multi-author</em>? <em>Public</em> or <em>private</em>?
<ul>
<li>Andy Matuschak’s <a href="https://notes.andymatuschak.org/About_these_notes">site</a> is a public, single-author creation</li>
<li>Jon Sterling’s <a href="https://www.jonmsterling.com/index.xml">site</a> is public but multi-author</li>
<li>Niklas Luhmann’s original Zettelkasten was private and single-author, and though it has since <a href="https://niklas-luhmann-archiv.de/">opened to the public</a>, that wasn’t its function during the author’s lifetime. Most, if not all, 20th Century Zettelkästen were private and single-author</li>
<li>Is there a private, multi-author  example? If so, I’m not aware of it, perhaps because, you know, it’s <em>private</em>. But such a thing might well exist.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Before seeing Jon Sterling’s site, I had held a simple distinction between the Zettlekasten and the Wiki. I don’t really wish to re-open an <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Zettelkasten/comments/p9prpp/whats_the_difference_between_zettelkasten_and_a/">old</a> <a href="https://forum.zettelkasten.de/discussion/2226/zettelkasten-vs-personal-wiki">argument</a>, but just want to make a small observation. For me, a Wiki is a public- or semi-public facing product in its own right, a kind of publication, whereas a Zettelkasten is a method or process to produce public-facing artifacts, but it isn’t one of these artifacts itself. But now I wonder whether you can’t do both back-stage and front-stage at the same time. In other words, it looks to me like Jon Sterling is creating a Zettelkasten by my definition (it’s a process to produce public-facing artifacts such as articles and presentations), but he’s <a href="https://notes.andymatuschak.org/Work_with_the_garage_door_up">working</a> with the <a href="https://www.robinsloan.com/lab/new-avenues/#garage">garage door open</a> (it’s a kind-of product in its own right). This is an interesting thing to watch, and it’s always fun to experience <a href="https://blog.fawny.org/2011/05/13/studio-mystique/">the mystique of the studio</a>.</li>
