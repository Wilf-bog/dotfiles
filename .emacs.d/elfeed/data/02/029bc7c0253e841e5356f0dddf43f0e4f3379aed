<p>In recent years, I worked in close collaboration with my friend and colleague, Takis Fotopoulos, who without question is one of the leading anarchist theories today, and is the founder of <a href="https://www.inclusivedemocracy.org">Inclusive Democracy</a> and the journal, <a href="https://www.inclusivedemocracy.org/journal/">The International Journal for Inclusive Democracy</a>, in which I published numerous articles. About this radical project, Takis says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>&#8220;This is the project for direct political democracy, economic democracy (beyond the confines of the market economy and state planning), as well as democracy in the social realm and ecological democracy. In short, Inclusive Democracy is a form of social organisation which re-integrates society with economy, polity and nature.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>The concept of Inclusive Democracy is derived from a synthesis of two major historical traditions: the classical democratic and the socialist. It also encompasses radical green, feminist, indigenous and liberation movements in the South.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>From the Inclusive Democracy perspective the world is in a multidimensional crisis, caused by the concentration of power in the hands of various elites, as a result of the establishment of the system of market/growth economy, representative democracy and the related forms of hierarchical structures. Inclusive Democracy is therefore not seen as a utopia but as probably the only way out of the present crisis.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>My most significant work with Takis and associates was assembling a collection of essays on the nature and application of the Inclusive Democracy perspective, which was published in both Greek and English in, respectively, 2008 and 2009. The book, which I edited and introduced, is entitled <em>Global Capitalism and the Demise of the Left: Renewing Radicalism Through Inclusive </em><i>Democracy.</i></p>
