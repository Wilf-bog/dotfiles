<p>In this ~42-minute video I comment on the topic of doing things with
intent and presence. I also switch to the rear camera of my phone to
provide a first-person perspective of my hike.</p>

<p>Some of the highlights:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The slow-paced experience is juxtaposed with and contrasted to the
fast-paced life we have. The rhythms of the workplace, the news
cycle, the pace of social media keep stimulating us but we are not a
participant in their world.</li>
  <li>It is too fast. We are disempowered because what we do is a mile
long but only a millimetre thick. There is no depth to it, as we are
forced to shift our attention to something else.</li>
  <li>Story about me not listening to background music anymore. I also
wrote a journal entry on the matter about the “music all around”:

  <li>Why I wanted to do things with intent, to be more intentful with my
choices. To be a participant instead of a spectator in my subjective
reality; to feel that I am doing something that has meaning for me,
even if it does not matter in the grand scheme of things.</li>
  <li>Instead of trying to multi-task, I focus on what I have given my
attention to. I do it with intent and commitment.</li>
  <li>How I want my sensations to be consistent with my immediate
environment. Paying attention to things makes me feel I am a member
of my world.</li>
  <li>Other relatable stories about events that made me think critically
of the fast-paced life I was living.</li>
  <li>How the slow-paced experience allows me to do things without feeling
burdened by them.</li>
</ul>
