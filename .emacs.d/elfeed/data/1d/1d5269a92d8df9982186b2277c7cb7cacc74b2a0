directly to an Org heading, using its <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CUSTOM_ID</code> property (creating
it, if necessary). I have already demonstrated this in video form:
<a href="https://protesilaos.com/codelog/2024-01-20-emacs-denote-link-org-headings/">https://protesilaos.com/codelog/2024-01-20-emacs-denote-link-org-headings/</a>.</p>

<p>As part of the development work towards version <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">3.0.0</code>, we now define
a new command that displays a buffer with backlinks to the current Org
heading: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-org-extras-backlinks-for-heading</code>. It is part of the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-org-extras.el</code> file, which contains optional extensions that
only work with Org mode files.</p>

<p>The name of the backlinks buffer includes the text of the heading it
is about.</p>

<p>Note that links to headings are also pointing to the underlying file,
using its identifier. They are a composite of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">FILE-ID::#HEADING-ID</code>,
which still leverages the robust Denote file-naming scheme.</p>

<h2>Part of the current development version</h2>

<p>Things are in a state of flux as we are fleshing out Denote <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">3.0.0</code>.
If you do try this feature, please let me know how it works for you
and if you would like to see something done differently.</p>

<p>Denote is highly flexible and designed to be easy to extend: you do
not have to be an expert. We do everything using small functions and
code that has no obscure macros and/or deeply nested expressions. This
will continue to be the case. So feel welcome to take a look and send
your feedback.</p>

<p>Version <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">3.0.0</code> will hopefully be released in June or July 2024.</p>

<h2>Denote sources</h2>

<p>Denote is a simple note-taking tool for Emacs.  It is based on the idea
that notes should follow a predictable and descriptive file-naming
scheme.  The file name must offer a clear indication of what the note is
about, without reference to any other metadata.  Denote basically
streamlines the creation of such files while providing facilities to
link between them.</p>

<p>Denote’s file-naming scheme is not limited to “notes”.  It can be used
for all types of file, including those that are not editable in Emacs,
such as videos.  Naming files in a consistent way makes their
filtering and retrieval considerably easier.  Denote provides relevant
facilities to rename files, regardless of file type.</p>
