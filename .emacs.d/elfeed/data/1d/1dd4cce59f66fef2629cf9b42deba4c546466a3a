<p>This week the Evolution Data Server library gained <a href="https://gnome.pages.gitlab.gnome.org/evolution-data-server/">a new homepage for its documentation</a> using GitLab for an always up-to-date version and GI-Docgen to align with the documentation of other libraries in the ecosystem.</p>

</h3><p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@hergertme:gnome.org">hergertme</a> announces</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The venerable GNOME Terminal is working towards moving to GTK 4! You can find an initial implementation has landed in the git repository. A number of things need to be worked out for GNOME 46 and you can help make that happen! See <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gnome-terminal/-/wikis/Gtk4Warts">https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gnome-terminal/-/wikis/Gtk4Warts</a> for some outstanding issues.</p>
<p>Additionally, VTE will now time it&rsquo;s rendering work based on the GdkFrameClock. This removes a longstanding issue where rendering would be capped around 40 frames-per-second.

<p>Hot of the press is <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/World/Phosh">Phosh</a> 0.33.0. The
release is a bit smaller than usual as we spent some timer modernizing
<a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/World/Phosh/phoc">phoc</a> to work well with wlroots git
but there&rsquo;s still some user visible improvements:</p>
<ul>
<li>a consistent toggle for password visibility in modal dialogs</li>
<li>a new lockscreen plugin to spawn apps. Most useful when you forgot to launch
your music player and don&rsquo;t want to unlock just for that</li>
<li>better troubleshooting information</li>

<blockquote>
<p>This week there were some technical difficulties, because TWIG-Bot (Hebbot) crashed during the creation of the issue (which is the reason for the delay).</p>
<p>This was caused by a <a href="https://github.com/haecker-felix/hebbot/commit/e1dadab9b9438ef3bd57e4c3164d3c6e01d78928">rare bug involving Unicode text splitting</a>. Thanks to the help of Sophie and Zander Brown, the problem was quickly identified and eliminated. I deployed a new updated version of the bot which fixes the crash.</p>
<p>Happy ending, the weekend is saved, I can publish TWIG! ü•≥</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This week, the Blueprint formatter was merged! üéâ You no longer have to worry about redundant whitespaces, forgotten indentations or random newlines anymore when editing your .blp files! This will make writing UI templates for GTK apps a <em>lot</em> more pleasant for developers.</p>
<p>The formatter is also part of the Blueprint LSP, meaning it should be integrated into development tools like GNOME Builder, VS Code and Workbench pretty soon.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to thank James Westman and Sonny for guiding me through the process of writing the formatter, they helped me a lot.

<p>You can use the <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/Teams/Websites/welcome.gnome.org/-/issues">project‚Äôs issue tracker</a> for feedback or create pull requests with content additions or corrections. If the content seems stable enough the pages will be submitted to our translation system within the next weeks, allowing for translation before the release.

You can now choose to place the indicator in either the left or right panel boxes or in one of four different positions in the central box. This is implemented in the main, GS45+ branch of the extension only.

<p><a href="https://github.com/flathub/flatpak-builder-lint">flatpak-builder-lint</a> is now capable of checking build directories and ostree repositories, regardless of the build tool used to produce an app. There also are new checks that ensure screenshots are properly mirrored and AppStream passes appstream-glib&rsquo;s validation. We have also started publishing a Docker image to make it easier to integrate it with external CI systems. See its README for details!</p>
<p>We are putting the finishing touches to the updates moderation in Flathub. We have been historically very lenient past the initial review, trusting no one will try to sneak through with potentially shoddy AppStream changes. New builds changing certain user-facing fields will be marked for review and withheld until manually approved (or not!).</p>
<p>The server-side validation and the moderation dashboard are the backbone of the upcoming direct uploads feature, that will allow verified developers to publish their apps directly, without poking me or being forced to use either GitHub or flatpak-builder. There is no launch date for that yet, but we are getting there!

<blockquote>
<p>Thanks to <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/pygobject/-/merge_requests/250">the stellar work of Arjan Molenaar</a>, the pygobject bindings have been dramatically improving over the past month. Now Python developers can finally use instances of fundamental types, which was one of the big blockers for people implementing custom widgets with GTK4.</p>
<p>Starting with the GNOME 46 run time, you&rsquo;ll be able to do advanced custom drawing using render nodes, as well as accessing low level windowing system event objects, in your Python applications.</p>
