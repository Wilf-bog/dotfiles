<p>I climbed the mountain and sat at its top, all while talking
philosophy.  This video is about an hour long.  These are the main
themes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Story about me when I was younger, which illustrates how I had the
appearance of discipline without a solid grasp of the “why”</li>
  <li>Continuation of that story, delving into my bad habit with alcohol
consumption.  The gist is that I overestimated my ability by
believing in my own narrative of how disciplined I was—a mistake.</li>
  <li>How can we have self-restraint without a good understanding of our
self and of our limits?</li>
  <li>Discussion on the introspection—the search for the “why”—that
made me understand the reason I was behaving in that bad way (where
alcohol was the facilitator and enabler of certain experiences).</li>
  <li>Tie it all together in an exposition about not talking big and not
overestimating our abilities.</li>
  <li>Comment on three more stories that further explain these and related
ideas.</li>
  <li>In short: be patient, take it slow, do not assume that you are
special, do not talk big, have a sense of purpose that is consistent
with your actuality, put yourself to the test in order to learn who
you are (what you can and cannot do).</li>
</ul>
