<p>During this year&rsquo;s Annual General Meeting on Friday, the annual Community Appreciation Award (a.k.a. Pants of Thanks) was awarded to someone who cares deeply about GNOME, helps out app developers (almost every single day), plays the guitar (but just one song), holds controversial opinions (some even turn out to be right), and who is a climate advocate and activist &hellip; Tobias Bernard! A standing ovation was offered along with a flattering pair of red and blue plaid pajama pants. Congratulations, Tobias!

<p>During the past year, I have been working on <a href="https://jwharm.github.io/java-gi">Java-GI</a>, a tool to generate Java language bindings for GNOME, GStreamer and other GObject-Introspection-based libraries, based on the new &ldquo;Panama&rdquo; preview API of OpenJDK 20 (JEP-434) for interconnecting the JVM and native code. The goal of Java-GI is to generate a pleasant API in which Java developers feel right at home: camel-case method names, automatic cleanup of resources, and Javadoc-style formatting and cross-references.</p>
<p>The latest Java-GI release 0.6.1 publishes Java bindings for Gtk4, LibAdwaita, GStreamer, GtkSourceview and WebkitGtk, and custom-developed bindings for Cairo. It is also possible to define your own GObject-derived classes in Java, and to create Gtk composite template classes. Visit the <a href="https://jwharm.github.io/java-gi">Java-GI website</a>, or check out the <a href="https://github.com/jwharm/java-gi-examples">examples</a> for more information.</p>
<p>Until now, I&rsquo;ve mostly been working on Java-GI on my own. I&rsquo;d very much appreciate if interested Java developers would try it out, send feedback on <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#java-gi:matrix.org">#java-gi:matrix.org</a> or <a href="https://github.com/jwharm/java-gi">github</a>, and become involved in further development.</p>

<p>Parabolic <a href="https://github.com/NickvisionApps/Parabolic/releases/tag/2023.7.3">V2023.7.3</a> is here!</p>
<p>In this release we improved the design of the Keyring dialog making it cleaner and more user friendly. We also added a History dialog that allows users to manage previously downloaded videos!</p>
<p>Behind the scenes, we upgraded to gir.core V0.4.0 which brings many improvements to using GTK and asynchronous programming in C#. As a result of this update, our code is a lot cleaner and easier to read.
