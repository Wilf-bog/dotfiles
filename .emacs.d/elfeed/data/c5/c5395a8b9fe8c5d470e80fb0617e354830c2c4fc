<p>For this entry I have picked a traditional song from Southern Italy,
performed by Alessandra Caiulo at the 2022 edition of <em>La Notte della
Taranta</em> festival: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3d3lKOywU">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3d3lKOywU</a>.  Its
original title is <em>Aremou</em> or <em>Aremou rindineddha mou</em>.</p>

<p>[ In my collection, I have the version of <em>Aremou</em> performed by the
  <em>Ghetonia</em> band, in their album <em>Per incantamento</em>.  The male voice
  gives it a different feel. ]</p>

<p>On first reading, this poem is about a bird, though we can draw
insights from it that apply to our everyday life.  Below are the
original lyrics in Griko, my Greek and English translations,
philosophical commentary, and some final notes on the applied
language.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Aremou rindineddha mou (Griko (Italiot Greek))


Aremou rindineddha mou
plia talassa se guaddhi
che apute ste che ftazzi
m'outo kalo chero

Vasta to peton aspro
mavre vasta tes ale
stavri kulor de mare
che i kuta en diu nihti

Kaímeno pros sti talassa
ego se kanonó
lio gherni, lio kaléi
lio ghizzi to nero

Ma sou tipo mou lei
ya posa se rotó
lio gherni, lio kaléi
lio ghizzi to nero

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Άραγε χελιδόνι μου (Ελληνικά)


Άραγε χελιδόνι μου
ποια θάλασσα σε φέρνει
και απού'τε (πώθε==από που) στες (στω==στέκομαι) και φτάνεις
μ'ούτο (με τούτο τον) καλό καιρό

Βαστάς (έχεις) στο πέτον (στήθος) άσπρο
μαύρο βαστάς στα φτερά
πλάτη σε χρώμα της θάλασσας
και η ουρά στα δυό ανοιχτή

Καημένος μπρος στη θάλασσα
εγώ σε κανονώ (σε συλλογίζομαι;---δες σημειώσεις παρακάτω)
λίγο γέρνεις, λίγο καλάρεις (πέφτεις)
λίγο γγίζεις το νερό

Μα σου τίποτε μου λέεις
για πόσα σε ρωτώ
λίγο γέρνεις, λίγο καλάρεις
λίγο γγίζεις το νερό

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>I wonder my Swallow (English)


I wonder my Swallow
which sea brings you
and where you stand and reach
in this fine weather

[You] Hold (have) white on the chest
black [you] hold on the wings
back in the colour of the sea
and the tail open in two

While grieving I stand by the sea
I canonise you (I contemplate you?---see notes below)
[you] tilt a little, descend a little
touch the water a little

Yet you say nothing
on what I ask you about
[you] tilt a little, descend a little
touch the water a little
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The song speaks of a migratory bird’s struggles as it crosses the
Mediterranean in hope of building its nest under the appropriate
living conditions.  Each year, the arrival of Swallows heralds the
start of Spring.  We admire the bird’s exuberance and what it
signifies for the changing seasons, though we seldom pause to ponder
the perils it goes through.</p>

<p>Every flight may be the Swallow’s last.  Sometimes the bird drops,
touches the water more than it can afford, and drowns amid the waves.
Yet life continues: more birds will keep flying to find the temperate
climate that is suitable for their survival; more Swallows will come
to tell us about the end of Winter.</p>

<p>The poetic “I” is sensitive and attuned to this small bird’s
experiences.  This alone teaches us that we have more in common with
other forms of life than what our inconsiderate colonialism over
nature wants to admit.  I need to migrate and find a place to call my
own and so does the Swallow.  I must proceed while taking care that my
next move is not the last and so must the bird and, indeed, every
other form of life.</p>

<p>This poetic first person shows a level of compassion that inspires us
to be more refined in our disposition.  There exists a whole world
outside our private space and our instituted reality; a world that
envelops and determines us, despite our anthropocentric pretences to
our exceptional status.  We cannot live without this world.</p>

<p>Why is the person grieving?  I think it is because of the
understanding that not all birds cross the sea.  For some, the
otherwise minor tilt is a free fall into their demise.  Such is the
natural course of things.  No-one wants it, but it happens regardless.</p>

<p>As for why the bird does not answer the person’s questions, I believe
it is due to its own grief over the loss of its loved ones.  It cannot
stop flying, though it at least remains silent in memory of those
fellow travellers who could not make it to the end of the trip.</p>

<p>The song then turns into an epic where the humble bird embodies what
each of us has to deal with in this life.  If our little hero can rise
to the occasion, then so can we.  I too can navigate those waters,
reach Salento, and cross paths with this poetic “I”.  Whether I will
be in a mood to answer any questions remains to be determined: the
journey must continue.</p>

<h2>Translation notes</h2>

<p>I generally find Griko intelligible, although <em>Aremou</em> has lots of
Italian words, probably for stylistic purposes (e.g. it has <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">talassa</code>
(sea) but also <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mare</code>).  I surmised that every unknown word is of
Italian origin and then proceeded through trial and error to find the
root meaning:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">rindireddha</code> is a variant of the Italian <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">rondinella</code>, which is the
Swallow.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">guaddhi</code> is a variant of the Italian verb <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">guadare</code> which means “to
wade”.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cali</code> is an Italian verb: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">calare</code>.  We have its conjugation in
Greek as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">καλάρω</code>.  It most likely is a loanword and probably comes
from sailors as it is related to dropping the ship’s anchor (from
what I can tell).  The Griko <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">kaléi</code> is a Hellenised version of
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cali</code>: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">καλέω</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">καλέεις</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">καλέει</code>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ale</code> is a variant of the Italian <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ala</code> which is the word for
“wing”.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">stavri</code> probably is an allusion to the Greek word for cross
(<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">stavrós</code> (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">σταυρός</code>)—yes, my surname is the second person of the
name Stávros (Σταύρος)) and is a shorthand for “to carry the cross”.
In the poem, we thus find <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">[to carry the cross] colour of the sea</code>,
which I interpret to mean that the colour is on the bird’s back.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">kuta</code> is a variant of the Italian <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cuta</code>, which is the “tail”.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Words such as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sou</code> (you) and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">lio</code> (a little) are also found in
Cypriot Greek.  Same for the pronunciation of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">che</code> (and) <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">chero</code>
(weather) and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ghizzi</code> (touches), which in Cypriot Greek are
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">τζιαι</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">τζιαιρό</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">γγίζζει</code>, respectively, although the
latter’s double <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">z</code> sounds like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">zee</code>, not <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">chi</code>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am unsure about <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">kanonó</code>, though I read it as the verb for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">canon</code>
as in establishing something as the norm.  To canonise is to
consider things in a certain way.  In the context of the poem, it
may thus be read as “I contemplate you”.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I could not find the root for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">aremou</code>.  I based it on the context,
as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">άραγε</code> (I wonder) makes perfect sense.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
