<p>This is episode 2 of a series I am introducing where I comment on the
book <em>Dao De Jing</em> by Lao Zi.  The present entry covers Chapter 2 of
the book and is concerned with understanding the extremes and
interconnectedness, dealing with uncertainty, maintaining the right
disposition in life, and behaving in moderation.</p>
