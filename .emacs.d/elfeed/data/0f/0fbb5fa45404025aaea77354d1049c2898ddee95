<p>This is an improved version of the <a href="https://zettelkasten.de/posts/teaser-zkm-book-flow-diagram/">diagram on the flow of value creation</a>. Three comments on that:</p>

<ol>
  <li>It goes from bottom to top because this direction reflects the increase of value better.</li>
  <li>It now shows the idealised boundaries of the Zettelkasten itself. It is possible to have the drafts within the Zettelkasten and the excerpts as well. However, this would detract from understanding the Zettelkasten Method.</li>
  <li>It shows why I use the term Zettelkasten Method. There are practical implications on how to design the overall workflow. Those are both individualised but also stand on general principles that are grounded in the nature of knowledge itself.</li>
</ol>
