<p>Just another video status update on my “hut project”.  I am building a
hut in the mountains of Cyprus to solve my housing woes.  Here I talk
about the preparatory work I am doing for the building’s foundation.
There still is a long way to go and I hope to continue with the same
level of intensity.</p>
