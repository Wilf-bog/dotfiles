<p>What follows is an excerpt from my notes.  I am sharing it as I recently
had a related discussion and need to have a link I can share (insert
meme about people on the Internet being wrong).</p>

<hr />

<p>The term “heterarchy” is employed as a de facto antonym of “hierarchy”.
It basically means “non-hierarchical” and that is how I used it a few
years ago when I was impressionable.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>heterarchy (ˈhɛtərɑːkɪ)</p>

  <p>a formal structure, usually represented by a diagram of connected
nodes, without any single permanent uppermost node. Compare hierarchy,
tree [from Greek heteros other, different + archē sovereignty]</p>

<p>While I don’t believe I will change anyone’s mind on this, I hold that
the term is inaccurate.  We can do better.</p>

<p>There is <em>heter</em> for “other” or “different” and then <em>arche</em> for the
kind of order where a given entity, be it person, office, or group,
takes precedence over those being governed.  Arche means the “beginning”
(starting point), but also “leadership”.  The latter can loosely be
interpreted as someone being at the starting point to show the way and
others following along.</p>

<p>The <em>archon</em>, else the ruler, cannot be defined in terms of <em>heteros</em>,
as the notion of an “other ruler” or “different ruler” is still
reducible to “ruler”: we continue to have a defined arche.  The concept
of a heterarch, meaning “other ruler”, is closely related to a condition
of <em>heteronomy</em>: a state of affairs where governance, or the effective
law (<em>nomos</em>), is controlled by another person or entity as opposed to
the one/those being governed.  From the perspective of the governed, the
entity which keeps them heteronomous can be considered heterarchic.</p>

<p>Perhaps heterarchy can be used to describe a scenario where one node
connects to multiple parent nodes.  In that regard, the concept of
“other” is appropriately included.  Still, archon is a problematic term
for something that represents connected nodes which may have nothing to
do with governance.  For example, the node labelled “American Pitbull
Terrier” connects to “Dog” which in turn connects to “Mammal”, but we do
not mean that the latter governs the former, strictly speaking.  Archon,
and then the primary archon (<em>kyriarchon</em> == sovereign), and all
derivatives connote governance or management in the sense of direct
control, of a ruler compelling you into action in the most practical
way.</p>

<p>Indeterminate uppermost nodes are likely to be observed in a note-taking
system where entries use tags to describe their relationships.  The tags
do not impose a state of governance.  They reveal patterns, which is a
more nuanced affair that bossing subjects around.</p>

<p>If we want to juxtapose one archon to another, we might use the <em>anti</em>
prefix, as in “antithesis”, “Antipolis” (opposite city; city on the
opposite side) and names like “Antipater” (“as opposed to—or in
comparison to—the father”).  This, however, requires a comparison
where the node has a direct anti-node.  It cannot be a general term to
denote a state where a node has no defined uppermost node and thus, may
be open-ended in some manner.</p>

<p>The gist is that “heterarchy” does not tell us what the structure is, as
the aforementioned definition suggests.  Semantically, it has nothing to
do with the notion of non-hierarchy, the negation of hierarchy, and the
like.  The negation and thus the absence of an <em>arche</em> is non-arche,
else <em>anarchy</em>.</p>

<p>The word “hierarchy” involves the composite of <em>hier</em> (holy), in
reference to priests.  In its basic form, the hierarch is the one who
manages—rules over—religious affairs.  Another term is “teletarch”,
where <em>telete</em> (τελετή) stands for “ceremony”: so the hierarch is the
master, or leader, or organiser of the ceremony and of the holy matters
more broadly.  The hierarchy then, is the noun which describes this
status.</p>

<p>Language is made and remade through its use.  It is clear that we apply
“hierarchy” for practically everything that resembles a pyramid-like
organigram.  The religious connotations are lost, though the meaning of
an arche persists, which is what matters to us right now.  Despite the
differences between the original meaning and how it is used ordinarily,
we are still referring to an order where a certain entity—individual
or group—takes precedence over others and thus is “at the beginning”,
as the origin of whatever power impulse compels and controls the
components of the given structure.</p>

<p>With the term “heterarchy”, we displace the now-irrelevant <em>hier</em> part
with the loaded <em>heter</em> prefix to ultimately cause confusion.</p>

<p>The right term for anything pertaining to an organisation, a diagram,
and the like is “taxis” (or “taxy”), literally “order”.  The previous
example with the dog is a case in point.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>taxis [ tak-sis ] noun, plural tax·es [tak-seez].</p>

  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>arrangement or order, as in one of the physical sciences.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Biology. oriented movement of a motile organism in response to an
external stimulus, as toward or away from light.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Surgery. the replacing of a displaced part, or the reducing of a
hernia or the like, by manipulation without cutting.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Architecture. the adaptation to the purposes of a building of its
various parts.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>We can then have composite terms like “heterotaxy” for a heterogeneous
or <em>heteroclite</em> order (here is the “hetero” again) and “homotaxy” for a
homogeneous or <em>homoclite</em> one (notice the parallel).  In Greek, we also
have terms like “parataxy” (think of the “para” in “parallel”) for
opposing orders, like conflicting political ideologies (i.e. partisans).</p>

<p>The suffix <em>clite</em> in “heteroclite” and “homoclite” means “inclination”
or direction and disposition (you can also find <em>hétéroclite</em> in
French).  A set, say a random group of people, is heteroclite when its
elements exhibit diversity and “move towards different directions” so to
speak.</p>

<p>When we employ those more accurate terms, we have the flexibility to
qualify the various <em>taxes</em> into, for example, those that resemble a
distributed network, others that look like a hierarchy (in the
contemporary, ordinary sense), those that exhibit an absence of an archy
or uppermost node (i.e. anarchy), and so on.</p>

<p>I must stress that I am not familiar with the field where the term
“heterarchy” originated from or is widely used in.  This is ultimately
me putting forth an alternative as I have no intention to use
“heterarchy” to signify “non-hierarchy” (and related).  I will use my
own words and refer the reader to this note if something is unclear.  I
believe I have justified myself.  Even if I am wrong, I can at least
claim that I tried.  Life is simple.</p>
