<p>This week we are welcoming our 50th app into <a href="https://circle.gnome.org/">GNOME Circle</a>. With only existing for 2¬Ω years, the GNOME Circle project has been an enormous success.</p>
<p>We thank all the app maintainers and other contributors for their dedicated work on all those apps. We will do our best to help the community to keep our apps at such good quality.

<blockquote>
<p>GJS 1.75.2 was released today, the beta release for the GNOME 44 series. Here&rsquo;s a selection of the new features:</p>
<ul>
<li>There are new <code>Gio.Application.prototype.runAsync()</code> and <code>GLib.MainLoop.prototype.runAsync()</code> methods which do the same thing as <code>run()</code> but return a Promise which resolves when the main loop ends, instead of blocking while the main loop runs. Use one of these methods (by awaiting it) if you use async operations with Promises in your application. Previously, it was easy to get into a state where Promises never resolved if you didn&rsquo;t run the main loop inside a callback. Thanks to Evan Welsh for working on this.</li>
<li>There are new <code>Gio.InputStream.prototype.createSyncIterator()</code> and <code>Gio.InputStream.prototype.createAsyncIterator()</code> methods which allow easy iteration of input streams in consecutive chunks of bytes, either with a for-of loop or a for-await-of loop. This addition is from Sonny Piers.</li>
<li>DBus proxy wrapper classes now have a static <code>newAsync()</code> method, which returns a Promise that resolves to an instance of the proxy wrapper class on which <code>initAsync()</code> has completed. Marco Trevisan laid the groundwork for this one.</li>
<li>DBus property getters can now return GLib.Variant instances directly, if they have the correct type, instead of returning JS values and having them be packed into GLib.Variants. A quick quality-of-life improvement from Andy Holmes.</li>
<li>Some long-existing typos in Cairo enums were spotted by V√≠tor Vasconcellos.</li>
<li>More Cairo improvements, tuberry created <code>Cairo.SVGSurface.prototype.finish()</code> and <code>Cairo.SVGSurface.prototype.flush()</code> because previously SVG surfaces were only written to disk when the SVGSurface
object was garbage collected, making it uncertain to rely on them.</li>

<p>I am excited to announce that <a href="https://github.com/SeaDve/Mousai">Mousai</a> now supports offline mode. Through this update, instead of an error, the recordings will be saved and then recognized once you&rsquo;re back online. This is perfect for anyone who needs to recognize audio on the go. Aside from that, there have been significant improvements in navigation to make it more natural and intuitive.

<blockquote>
<p>Hello all! Fractal 4.4.2-beta2 is available on Flathub Beta.</p>
<p>You read correctly, it&rsquo;s not Fractal 5 yet. This is a maintenance release that fixes the compilation of Fractal 4.4 with recent libraries and allows to build the Flatpak with the latest GNOME runtime. That means no more warning that the GNOME 41 runtime is outdated!</p>
<p>There are no new features, but since we updated a lot of Rust dependencies we preferred to release a beta version before using it to update our stable release to the latest runtime. So please test it and if no major regression is reported, we will release it as stable in two weeks.</p>
<p>To get it, run the following commands:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-sh" data-lang="sh">flatpak remote-add --if-not-exists flathub-beta https://flathub.org/beta-repo/flathub-beta.flatpakrepo
flatpak install flathub-beta org.gnome.Fractal
flatpak run --branch<span style="color:#f92672">=</span>beta org.gnome.Fractal
</code></pre></div><p>Note that if you always want to use this beta version instead of the stable one, and run it from the icon in your launcher, you will need to change its desktop file to use the command in the last line.</p>
<p>See you soon with some news regarding Fractal 5 hopefully!</p>

</h3><p>Easily run Windows software on Linux with Bottles!</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@theevilskeleton:fedora.im">Hari Rana (TheEvilSkeleton)</a> says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Bottles 51.0 was just released! As said last time, we focused on fixing bugs and quality of life changes.</p>
<p>We revamped the &ldquo;New Bottle&rdquo; interface, to address several issues that were raised from users, including but not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>There wasn‚Äôt a clear indicator for which environment was chosen, especially when the Custom environment was selected and then collapsed.</li>
<li>The window would increase and shrink in each page, and when the Custom environment was selected or collapsed. This caused a lot of distractions as the window would expand and shrink unexpectedly.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are also minor quality of life changes that will hopefully improve the user experience:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Library icon has been changed from a heart to books, to represent a libary.</li>
<li>There is now a toast when launching executables with &ldquo;Run Executable&rdquo;. Before, there wasn&rsquo;t a clear indicator when the program was launching.</li>
<li>Runners are now sorted according to a priority list. From the highest to the lowest priority: Soda, Caffe, Vaniglia, Lutris, and then the rest. Whenever you want to create a new bottle, or change the runner of an existing bottle, everything will be displayed in order.</li>
<li>Bottles can now be named without any character restrictions. This means, for example, &ldquo;Assassin&rsquo;s Creed&rdquo;, &ldquo;Sid Meier‚Äôs Civilization&rdquo;, or &ldquo;Paw Patrol: On A Roll&rdquo; are now valid names.</li>
<li>Bottles will now send a notification when a bottle has been created, but only when the window is unfocused.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are also several bug fixes that include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Adding a shortcut to Steam wouldn&rsquo;t add and would throw an error.</li>
<li>Importing full backups wouldn&rsquo;t import and would throw an error.</li>
<li>A lot of various issues with the library, like empty covers and crashes.</li>
<li>Various bugs regarding text encoding, in games and in Bottles</li>
<li>Bottles list not being updated correctly after deleting a bottle.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can find all information in the <a href="https://usebottles.com/blog/release-51.0/">release page</a>!

This week I‚Äôve been preparing for our booth at <a href="https://www.socallinuxexpo.org/scale/20x">SCaLE</a> next month by ordering new GNOME t-shirts and writing messages about the event to share in our Friends of GNOME newsletter and on our social channels. I&rsquo;ve also been working on building registration forms for <a href="https://linuxappsummit.org/">Linux App Summit (LAS)</a> (look for event registration to open very soon), designing LAS merchandise (these will be for sale in person by per-order or online in the LAS shop), addressing lots of GUADEC 2023 planning tasks, and working on the GNOME 44 release video with <a href="https://freehive.com/">Freehive</a>.</p>
<p>Contributors welcome! If you would like to join me in working on GNOME social media or Foundation and Engagement Team graphic design projects find me on matrix @chenriksen.</p>
<p>Open Calls for Participation:
We‚Äôre still looking for locations for both GNOMEAsia 2023, and GUADEC 2024. If you‚Äôre interested in learning more about hosting a GNOME event or want to submit a proposal for either of our open calls you can learn more about GNOMEAsia 2023 <a href="https://foundation.gnome.org/2023/01/12/call-for-gnome-asia-2023-bids/">here</a> or GUADEC 2024 <a href="https://foundation.gnome.org/2023/01/27/call-for-guadec-2024-bids/">here</a>. Deadlines for both of these bids are coming up soon so submit your proposals asap!</p>
