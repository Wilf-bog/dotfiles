<p>I have just finalised the refactoring of <a href="https://protesilaos.com/books">the books’
section</a>.  Overview of the changes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>There is a new feed available at <a href="https://protesilaos.com/books.xml">https://protesilaos.com/books.xml</a>.
In the past I would post in the News section (i.e. here and eventually
on the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">news.xml</code> feed) about any new publication.  That will no longer
happen.  Follow the new <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">books.xml</code>.  If you need any help about web
feeds, read <a href="https://protesilaos.com/feeds/">my RSS feed info page</a> or
<a href="https://protesilaos.com/contact">contact me</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All old links/URLs have been instructed to redirect to new ones.  No
further action is required of visitors to this website.  The old
format was both unsustainable and uninformative.  For example, my
<em>Notes on the Thinkable</em>, from 2013, had a URL that did not contain
the date of publication or the placement of the entry inside the
domain: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">https://protesilaos.com/notes-on-the-thinkable-2-0</code>.  That
was a historical accident from the time I was using a Wordpress blog
and knew next to nothing about computers in general.  Now all URLs
include the date of publication and the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">books</code> specifier, like this:
<a href="http://protesilaos.com/books/2013-11-27-notes-on-the-thinkable/">http://protesilaos.com/books/2013-11-27-notes-on-the-thinkable/</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All old books, like the <em>Little Guide to the European Union</em> (2016)
and <em>Structured Text on Sovereignty, Nationhood, Statehood</em> (2018)
have been consolidated into single files.  In the past, I would keep
every chapter as a distinct file, each with its own metadata, which I
thought was a neat idea.  But to make the book work like an index of
standalone items, I had to manually create the “mini website” of each
publication.  It involved several ad-hoc administrative tasks that I
will not bother you with.  The gist is that now the act of publishing
a book is as simple as publishing any entry: just a single file.  My
only hope is that the consolidation went well and no data was lost in
the transition (though I will conduct a review in the near future and
I do have access to the version history).</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Apart from subscribing to a new web feed, there is nothing you need to
do.  All those hours of work were necessary to fix problems that
accumulated over time; problems that were caused by my lack of knowledge
of how websites are pieced together.</p>

<p>While I did not bother to read everything again, I did study a few
passages.  Much of what I wrote is relevant today, though I do not care
about longer term consistency.  It is in the nature of the critical
thinker to be at odds with their previous self and to alienate former
sympathisers in the process.</p>
