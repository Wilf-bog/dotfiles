<p>Hi Zettlers,</p>

<p>This is a little flow diagram that illustrates the Zettelkasten Process with the help of one of the principles of the Zettelkasten Method, “Creating Pre-Products”:</p>

<p><em>The concept “excerpt” might be interpreted as “literature note” since both concepts are similar.</em> To me, creating an excerpt is a methodological approach of using tools to understand a text. So it is more than just about creating notes on thoughts and ideas embedded in a source. (Check out this <a href="https://zettelkasten.de/posts/concepts-sohnke-ahrens-explained/">explanation of Ahrens’s terms, including “literature note”</a>, if you want to learn more.)</p>

<p><em>Flow diagrams can distract from the actual sites of value creation. They are mostly for superficial overview.</em> There are a couple of different ways to translate the Zettelkasten Method into a flow diagram. At this moment, two flow diagrams including this one are part of the book. I don’t stress the concept of work<em>flow</em> since I fear that it is rather distracting from the more valuable aspects of the Zettelkasten Method. For example: It is by far more important to be able to write a good note than to have some process put in place to extract digital reading highlights from Kindle to the app of your choice.</p>

<p>If you want to improve your own way of processing knowledge, you may ask yourself: <strong>Do you have an unbroken chain of transforming the sources of your world into publications, improved habits and actions?</strong></p>
