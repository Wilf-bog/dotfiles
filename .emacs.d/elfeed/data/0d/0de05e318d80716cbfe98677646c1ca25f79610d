<p>I believe that many of the problems in our economy or politics in
general spring from the misinterpretation of intellectual property and
its consequent weaponisation by oligopolistic interests.  The logic of
exclusivity and the concomitant practice of artificial scarcity force
people towards becoming individualistic, which ultimately benefits the
establishment that wants us weak and divided.  Cooperation is
discouraged so that corporations can further increase their profits,
typically to the detriment of society and the planet.</p>

<p>With these in mind, I decided to sign the <a href="https://publicdomainmanifesto.org/manifesto/#en">Public Domain
Manifesto</a>.  It is a
step in the right direction.  I encourage you to study and support it.</p>
