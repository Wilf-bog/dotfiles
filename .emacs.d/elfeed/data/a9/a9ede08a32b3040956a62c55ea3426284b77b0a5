<p>I hiked and talked philosophy for a bit more than an hour.  I covered
a broad set of topics related to the expression “sorry for being a
burden”.  An overview:</p>

<ul>
  <li>We start feeling like a burden when we are coping with some
difficult situation.  We think that others are doing well, while we
are not.</li>
  <li>We do not want to bring others to our misery, so we avoid them.</li>
  <li>Not wanting to externalise our negativity in this way comes from a
good starting point: we consider the wellness of others.</li>
  <li>An explanation of how this apparent altruism is biased both against
us and against the others.  We think we are worthless while they are
impeccable.</li>
  <li>When we think we are a burden, we develop a sense of egocentrism
even though we do not want to.  We do it by obsessing about our
condition.</li>
  <li>Our obsession turns into a misplaced sense of exceptionalism as we
think we are special in our agony: “I am special because I am the
only one who suffers”.</li>
  <li>There is a “transmission mechanism” by which this ostensible burden
can be distributed.  Explanation of how this relates to the
communicative aspect of the human condition.</li>
  <li>We cannot opt out of our humanity.  To be sorry for being human is
pointless.  We always communicate.</li>
  <li>When we communicate with others, we open ourselves to their
positivity.  In general, we remove the obstacles that worsen our
condition.</li>
  <li>Explanation of moderation, of finding a middle way between the
extremes.</li>
  <li>More comments on the perversion of self-hatred that masquerades as
altruism.</li>
  <li>Practical ways to gradually escape from the overthinking loop.  We
break the cycle by acting.  Also comment on one’s physical condition
and how idle energy is contributing to the problem.</li>
  <li>We live in a world where we forget to be human sometimes and are
absorbed in our little bubble—practical step to avoid that.</li>
  <li>Example with how we do not control how others perceive our messages
and why we should not blame our self or them.</li>
  <li>Don’t judge and be patient.</li>
</ul>
