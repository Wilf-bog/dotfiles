</h3><p>A simple and modern image viewer.</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@sophieherold:gnome.org">Sophie üè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåà üè≥Ô∏è‚Äç‚ößÔ∏è ‚úä</a> announces</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We have landed all features planned to make Loupe a suitable image viewer for GNOME Core. As a next step, we will primarily focus on removing bugs and polishing what we have.</p>
<p>While basic image editing features are very frequently requested, it&rsquo;s very unlikely it will make it into GNOME 45. Much work is needed on different levels, especially in the libraries that handle image formats. I want to work on that in the future, but this is nothing that should be done under time pressure. Please let me know if you are experienced with image formats and/or rust and want to help!</p>
<p>Since our last update, we have:</p>
<ul>
<li>Landed image printing.</li>
<li>Added ICC color profile support for JPEG, PNG, HEIC, and AVIF.</li>
<li>Filled an upstream fix for ICC profiles in PNGs.</li>
<li>Made the overlay buttons hide after inactivity.</li>
<li>Let Loupe correctly advertise to the system what images it supports.</li>
<li>Made dragging the image also work with the middle mouse button.</li>
<li>Optimized SVG rendering, showing a complete image more quickly when zooming for huge SVGs.</li>
<li>Allow to drag and drop multiple images into Loupe to browse through those images.</li>
<li>And finally made our CI builds three times faster on average.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thanks to everyone who helped with contributions, bug reports, and advice.

<p>We also fixed some issues, including an issue where not all logs were shown for a download.

<p>First off, a new Notes field was added to transactions to allow users to write whatever extra notes they may choose for a transaction. We also added support for choosing to export all account information or just the transactions shown in the current filtered and sorted view. Support for displaying native digits instead of just Latin ones when working with numeric amounts was also added.</p>
<p>Besides these new features, we also fixed many issues including an issue where custom separators would not parse correctly and an issue where CSV files were not exported in the correct format.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This week we finally merged <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/CoderThomasB">Thomas</a> support for handling emergency calls into Phosh.  Whenever gnome-calls reports available emergency numbers you can now either select them from an emergency contact list or dial them via the keypad (doesnt' matter if your phone is locked or not). You currently have to opt in via a configuration option as we want to get more testing feedback before enabling it by default - it would be bad if that feature failed you in a real emergency. Apart from that we landed some visual tweaks related to notifications, system modal dialogues and screenshots.

</h3><p>Plot and manipulate data in a breeze!</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@sjoerdb93:matrix.org">Sjoerd Stendahl</a> says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I am happy to announce that we have finally released Graphs 1.5! Graphs is a simple, yet powerful tool that allows you to plot and manipulate your data with ease. Data can be imported from column-files stored in most formats, or generated using an equation. You can easily manipulate or transform the data in various ways such as cutting, translations, multiplications, derivatives, fourier transforms and more. Some major highlights of this release include:</p>
<ul>
<li>A major overhaul of the UI: Graphs now tries to follows the GNOME HIG, giving a nice and consistent experience in GNOME</li>
<li>A fully featured plot style editor: The style of your plot can now be saved in our now style editor where setting such as plot colours, ticks, the grid and even the default color cycle are all stored. A new plot style can easily be applied on an open project to quickly change your graph styling for a specific purpose</li>
<li>Saving projects: Projects can now be saved as a single file, which can be opened later for further use. Allowing you to continue where you left off.</li>
<li>Improved clipboard behaviour: Adding new data no longer resets the clipboard. And more actions are now included in the clipboard as well, so actions such as changing line colours, adding data, removing data and changing line names can all be undone/redone using the clipboard features.</li>
<li>Tons of bug fixes and changes under the hood. Most code has been updated since the previous release.</li>
<li>And many more changes, such as support for Panalytical .xrdml files, the ability to set the canvas limits from Plot Settings, the ability to reorder data by drag-and-drop within the side-panel, and a bunch of additional toast pop-ups to give the user feedback on specific occasions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thanks to everyone involved in helping out. Specifically <a href="https://github.com/cmkohnen">@cmkohnen</a>, who&rsquo;s been co-developing Graphs with me, and I&rsquo;d also want to thank Tobias Bernard  for his useful feedback and help with the user interface! The latest release of Graphs can be found on <a href="https://flathub.org/apps/details/se.sjoerd.Graphs">Flathub</a>.
