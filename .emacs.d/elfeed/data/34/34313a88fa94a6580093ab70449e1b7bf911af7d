<p>Milan Crha has <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gnome-software/-/merge_requests/1552">added progress reporting</a> to rpm-ostree downloads in GNOME Software, so updates in Silverblue should now have a more useful progress bar</p>

<p>Dynamic Wallpaper <a href="https://github.com/dusansimic/dynamic-wallpaper/releases/tag/0.1.0">v0.1.0</a> has landed! It&rsquo;s a simple app that helps you make a dynamic wallpaper that changes if you use light or dark mode in GNOME (the type of wallpaper has been released with GNOME 42).</p>
<p>Thanks to over 20 contributors, this new release is finally ready. Version 0.1.0 brings a new clean design that nicely blends into rest of modern GNOME apps. It lets you give a name to your new wallpaper, select which file would be used for light mode and which for dark mode and by clicking the &ldquo;Create&rdquo; button, you&rsquo;re ready to go üöÄ.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve first released this app in April this year but have not been able to bring it to a point that I&rsquo;m satisfied enough with the ui that I&rsquo;d be happy to share it here. Thanks to Hacktoberfest, there have been many contributions to the project an so far it has been translated to 13 languages üòÅ.</p>
<p>The app is so far available on FlatHub and AUR.

It has been a while since the last release, but you can expect more updates in the following months, starting with customizable keyboard shortcuts.</p>

<p><code>nautilus-code</code> is a Files (nautilus) extension that adds right-click menu options to open current/selected folder in a code editor or IDE e.g. VSCode, GNOME Builder, etc. Click <a href="https://github.com/realmazharhussain/nautilus-code#currently-supported">here</a> to see a full list of supported code editors and IDEs or <a href="">here</a> to request support for a code editor or IDE.</p>
<p>This version</p>
<ul>
<li>adds support for Nautilus 43</li>
<li>fixes an issue where folder paths with whitespaces in them were not handled properly</li>
</ul>
<p>Unfortunately, to add support for Nautilus 43, support for 42 and earlier had to be dropped. So, an accompanying legacy version (<a href="https://github.com/realmazharhussain/nautilus-code/releases/tag/legacy%2Fv0.5">v.5.0.legacy</a>) which supports Nautilus 42 and earlier, was also released.</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@theevilskeleton:fedora.im">Hari Rana (TheEvilSkeleton)</a> announces</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Bottles 2022.11.14 was released!</p>
<p>In this update, the details view has been completely redesigned to improve the user friendliness of Bottles. The sidebar has been removed and the pages have been moved into the details view itself.</p>
<p>The option to run an executable is much more prevalent and launch options are neatly placed in their own dropdown next to it. Options to add and install programs have been moved after the programs list.</p>
<p>Settings page has also received an overhaul. Similar settings have been rearranged into groups, making it easier to navigate and find options.</p>
<p>A lot of quality of life improvements have been made to Bottles to improve usability. ‚ÄúStates‚Äù have been renamed to ‚ÄúSnapshots‚Äù, several dialogs have been rephrased, ‚ÄúDocumentation‚Äù has been renamed to ‚ÄúHelp‚Äù, &ldquo;kill&rdquo; was renamed to &ldquo;force stop&rdquo; to avoid using violent terms, several mnemonics were added, along with a few more improvements that bring Bottles closer to GNOME Human Interface Guidelines.</p>
