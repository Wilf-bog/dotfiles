<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m trying to figure out how to start Emacs with a default window layout that sticks, and I got lost in the weeds of trying different packages recommended by several articles:</p> <p><a href="https://www.masteringemacs.org/article/demystifying-emacs-window-manager">https://www.masteringemacs.org/article/demystifying-emacs-window-manager</a></p> <p><a href="https://karthinks.com/software/emacs-window-management-almanac/">https://karthinks.com/software/emacs-window-management-almanac/</a></p> <p>I&#39;d like the layout to look something like this: <a href="https://imgur.com/a/5NS7Es4">https://imgur.com/a/5NS7Es4</a></p> <p>But I&#39;m completely lost.</p> <p>I understand that I need to set dedicated windows, but I am unable to figure out how Treemacs fits into that.</p> <p>If someone could help with the basic layout, I can probably figure out the dedicated buffers/windows configuration. Please help!</p> <p>Edited to add: After reading Micky Peterson&#39;s guide &quot;Demystifying Emacs&#39; Window Manager&quot; I <em>think</em> I understand the <code>display-buffer-alist</code> better now. I also tried saving a layout to <code>.emacs.desktop</code> and I&#39;m reading through that, too. I think what is causing issues for me is the Treemacs sidebar window is special and doesn&#39;t use a window. This is definitely a big ol&#39; can of worms!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/bloopernova"> /u/bloopernova </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/1e6e7ui/is_it_possible_to_use_treemacs_in_a_split_sidebar/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/1e6e7ui/is_it_possible_to_use_treemacs_in_a_split_sidebar/">[comments]</a></span>
