<p>So when I moved to Berlin a few years ago I probably &#8220;used&#8221; the city more than living in it. Like I enjoyed (and still enjoy) all the cultural, social, etc. offerings but I didn&#8217;t care too much about where I lived &#8211; as long as the connection to public transportation were good. If something happened somewhere, I got on my bike or took the subway and came back later.</p>



<p>We move to a different place when our kid was born. It&#8217;s a less fancy district of Berlin, one that people warn you about a bit. A very diverse place with people from all over the world &#8211; but very few of them would call themselves &#8220;expats&#8221;. Wedding (that&#8217;s the district&#8217;s name) was always a working class environment and it still has &#8211; to a degree &#8211; resisted gentrification.</p>



<p>When my son got bigger we were very lucky to find a daycare in walking distance. So apart from pushing a baby stroller through the neighborhood in order to magically conjure sleep I have been for a few years now been forced to be a bit more tied to this neighborhood. I actually live here now, people recognize me and I do them, they talk to my son, he&#8217;s become friends with the guys running the kebab shop down the road and so on.</p>



<p>I&#8217;ve not really made a lot of new friends here or formed massively meaningful connections. But I&#8217;ve learned to appreciate this forced sharing of the space, the neighborhood. Especially when one&#8217;s young/untethered it&#8217;s easy to pretty explicitly choose who to interact with, who to engage. For me that changed. And that&#8217;s not always delightful. Not everyone&#8217;s different life is an inspiration or fun to watch. Some people have drawn a really shitty hand in life.</p>



<p>But there is meaning in being in this environment. Being part of it without turning it into a big part of one&#8217;s identity. Being forced to be exposed to other lives.</p>



<p>This made me think about the digital spaces we inhabit. Because whether it&#8217;s by active choice (&#8220;I follow you&#8221;) or algorithmically &#8211; our digital spaces are structured the same way I used to &#8220;use&#8221; this city: Focused on us in the center, on our &#8220;wants&#8221; and &#8220;filters&#8221;. We choose our feeds and communities.</p>



<p>And I&#8217;m not saying that that&#8217;s bad. I think chosen communities and families are often more important that the ones we are forced into with all the baggage they tend to entail. </p>



<p>But I wonder what we lose by not having these shared spaces of heterogenity in our digital lives.</p>



<p>We call digital services and platforms we use to build communities &#8220;spaces&#8221; sometimes. And that metaphor isn&#8217;t totally wrong: These structures do have spatial qualities &#8211; while being built on a fundamentally different form of &#8220;physics&#8221; than the tangible space. But I feel like we haven&#8217;t found ways to express these experiences of sharing a space not with people you have to either block or engage with or discover or whatever other term some person trying to market their app comes up with but just with people. Who are different in ways you might not know, might not even need to know but that you give a friendly nod to while passing. </p>



<p>What is the digital equivalent of that?</p>
