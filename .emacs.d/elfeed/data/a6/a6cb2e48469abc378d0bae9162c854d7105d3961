<p>In this ~35 minute walk I talk about philosophical themes related to
artificial intelligence and our attitudes towards it.  In outline:</p>

<ul>
  <li>There are similarities between modern attitudes towards AI and how
ancient folks would treat oracles as authoritative and infallible.</li>
  <li>Story about the Oracle of Apollon in Delphi and how it would provide
non-answers to questions that could not be reduced to a “yes or no”.</li>
  <li>Explanation of how we must think about complexity and what our
attitude should be towards presumed oracular wisdom.</li>
  <li>Oracles or AI are neither good nor bad.  It depends on how we deal
with them.  Discussion about being gullible or not.</li>
  <li>Story about Prometheus, the know-how of fire, and whether tools are
good/bad for us.</li>
  <li>Avoiding extremes by trying to be less presumptuous about our
capacity for good/evil.</li>
  <li>Switching gears to individuals affairs.  Talk about feelings of
expertise; of setting goals and accomplishing them.</li>
  <li>There is value to be had in mastery, in not copy-pasting answers,
but in actually understanding things in-depth.</li>
  <li>Talk about how prior notes/work frames and limits our creativity.
AI can do the same if we get in the bad habit of not putting in the
hard work.</li>
  <li>Connection between these insights and what I covered at length in my
presentation about “productivity, honesty, and accountability
structures”:

  <li>Do not underestimate your potential and how you can feel inexorable
when you put in the effort.</li>
</ul>
