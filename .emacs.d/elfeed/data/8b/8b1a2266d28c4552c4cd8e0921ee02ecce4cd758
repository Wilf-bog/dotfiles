<p>I am repurposing my <a href="https://protesilaos.com/politics/">politics blog</a>.  No more writing
specifically about the EU.  I intend to comment on themes that are
common to many locations and which seem to define the world we live in.</p>

<p>Ever since 2011, I have been writing about the European Union, from the
eurocrisis to the broader issues of the European integration process.
I have learned a lot in the meantime and was able to develop theories
about general topics that extend beyond the confines of the EU politics
bubble.  Those findings are documented in several analyses and
books—just peruse the various sections of this website.</p>

<p>What I intend to do now is write about something perhaps a bit more
revolutionary, alternative, forward-thinking.  To explore topics that
stand at the intersection of legal-institutional affairs, economics, and
technology.  I wish to draw from history and to review certain concepts
or phenomena we may be taking for granted or accept at face value.</p>

<h2>Why the switch?</h2>

<p>I no longer see the value in a niche blog about the EU.  Those who want
to learn about daily affairs get their news and opinion from established
media outlets.</p>

<p>Meanwhile social media has radically changed the expectations people
have about political commentary.  Long-form writing on current issues is
not in demand.  The audience wants snippets of insight, embellished with
some data or exaggerated reference, depending on the context.</p>

<p>Put simply, my kind of blog is running out of business.</p>

<h2>Onwards and upwards</h2>

<p>I expect to publish the first article <em>before the end of 2018</em>.
Otherwise an update will be made in January 2019.</p>

<p>Please stay tuned for more—I think you might like the new content.  By
the by, note that <em>I no longer have any social media accounts</em>.  You
will have to check this website manually, or subscribe to updates via
RSS feeds.  I explain the latter in <a href="https://protesilaos.com/feeds/">this page</a> and offer links
on what to follow.</p>
