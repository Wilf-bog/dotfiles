I stumbled upon it again today which is why we are finally publishing it, sorry for the delay, but I&#8217;m sure this raw piece of darkness will definitely be of interest to many of you Fuzzers]</em></p>

<p class="has-text-align-center" style="text-align: left;"><b><em>Horehound</em>’s </b>third full-length album<b> <em>Collapse</em> “</b>stands”<b> </b>on its own. Pittsburgh, PA’s maestros of doom/post-goth sounds dropped Collapse on May 27, 2022.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-center" style="text-align: left;">For long-time listeners (and new ones alike) the maturity and texture on this album are sure to please.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: center;">How&#8217;s The Sound?</h3>
<p>The six tracks on <em><strong>Collapse</strong> </em>make for a very cohesive listening journey.  While each song remains unique, the stylistic thread is consistently “<em>Horehound</em>”. In their own words about this effort and their growth… “lyrical themes and underlying rawness have always been there, but <strong>our sound is really coming to a point… heavy and tight – we&#8217;re completely dedicated to diving inwards</strong>. We’re writing music for us.”<u></u><u></u></p>
<p>Overall this album, compared to prior releases by the band, is <strong>more blackened in sound and more traditionally &#8220;metal&#8221;</strong>.  <strong>Instrumentation is very crisp and discernable…</strong> steady drums, plodding heavy riffs from the strings – generally slow to mid-tempo – while vocals range from the expected atmospheric clean-style poetry from front-woman <em>Shy Kennedy</em> to raspy, growly, and guttural belting within songs.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">A note on the album production, which can make or break any musician&#8217;s effort&#8211; For <em>Collapse</em>, a heavy nod to the engineering. <strong>The effort is polished, layered, balanced</strong>. <br />Hats off to Sid Riggs (recording &amp; producing) and Tony Reed (mastering).</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><br />Why is this album worth listening to?</h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Heavy but dynamic doom metal throughout</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Neck exercises – challenging to refrain from head nodding</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">First full album with this current lineup, who started the process in 2020</li>
</ul>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><br />In what situation should you listen to this album?</h3>
<p>When feeling anguished, angry and need to “get it out”</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">Something particular to note?</h3>
<p>I’m happy to call <b>Horehound</b> mates, colleagues, and most recently co-performers. I’m even happier that I <i>genuinely</i> love what they’ve done with this album and witnessing the evolution these musicians have made in their craft.</p>
