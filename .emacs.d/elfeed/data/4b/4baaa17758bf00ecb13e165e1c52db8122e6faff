<p>In this ~20-minute video, I show the area close to the stream that I
have been working on. I installed a new pipe earlier today to make it
easier for me to water the trees I have planted there. The work I am
doing in this spot is to prevent the stream from over eroding the soil
that leads to my hut. The trees I have planted are there for the same
reason.</p>

<p>Here is how this place was a few months ago:</p>
