<p>Yesterday I almost suffered a major injury.  My beard caught fire as I
was about to put my sourdough bread in the oven.  I managed to
extinguish it quickly, but had already lost a good portion of its left
side.  I could still trim it to about the length of my neck (was up to
my chest before), but decided to shave it off completely.  Now I am even
uglier than before, which is quite the accomplishment!<sup id="fnref:Ugliness" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:Ugliness" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> Though
I am not here to write about hair, but to use this event as a reminder
of one of the themes I have been writing about for the last few months
on the matter on non-ownership.  Some publications that come to mind:</p>

<p>A beard is an attribute of a person’s appearance.  By extension, it is a
factor of identification.  We can say that Protesilaos is the person
with the long black beard (ceteris paribus).  In this formulation, the
beard is inseparable from the person which, in turn, influences the
perceptions of others but also the self-image of the person.</p>

<p>Identification of this sort creates attachments.  The person grows fond
of the attribute, perhaps by thinking that it flatters their figure or
otherwise adds to their personality.  Long beard and philosophy: the
stereotypes write themselves!  Similarly, others develop an association
between the underlying person and their appearance encapsulated in the
phrase “you look like a philosopher!”</p>

<p>Attachments engender a false sense of security and ownership.  Those
involved believe that the identity hitherto established is necessary and
shall remain constant.  In truth, the presence or absence of an
attribute is ephemeral, coincidental, or otherwise contingent on factors
beyond the scope of the person’s personhood.  Put simply, an accident
takes away that which was never truly ours.</p>

<p>We may think that hair is not a big deal, anyway, as it can always grow
back for as long as the hair follicles are in place.  This too is a
false sense of ownership.  The accident could have just as easily burnt
my face and caused irreparable damage to that area.  We would still be
dealing with a case of actual non-ownership, of not having what we think
is ours.</p>

<p>Appearances are all alienable.  By “alienable” I mean that they can be
separated from us.  Everything we think we have, everything we consider
“ours” is alienable.  Not just hair.  I even think that our sense of
self is alienable, as demonstrated by cases of amnesia or dementia.  Our
consciousness is alienable as well.  Ultimately, the “I” construct is
predicated on the assumption that some underlying qualities are fixed.</p>

<p>There is no “I” as a standalone presence; there is no “I” which is
independent from the mechanics of the system of systems we call “human
organism”.  As there is no human organism as a standalone presence, the
“I” is always a function of the case’s constitution.  By the “case’s
constitution”, I mean the interplay of relevant factors which together
contribute to the prevailing states of affairs.</p>

<p>In terms of selfhood, this is why I think we are variables and that our
sense of self is a subjective narrative.  There is no “true self”,
strictly speaking.  There can be honesty, which leads to an
approximation of what likely is the case, but there still is no natural
constant to speak of.</p>

<p>We then come to the realisation that it is misguided to be dismayed by
the loss of something we never actually owned.  By admitting to
non-ownership we develop the disposition of tranquillity, where we take
life for what it is, not how we would want it to be.  We accept what
appears to us as a loss, for it is how things work and, in the same way,
we do not get disturbed (excited or disappointed) by what comes our way,
be it seemingly good or bad.  We never become invested in anything: not
a beard, not some social status, not another presence, nothing!  We
remain aloof from the fray.</p>

<p>This is not say that we grow emotionless and disinterested.  Emotions
are an integral part of our humanity.  We cannot turn into non-humans
while remaining decisively human.  What we need instead is to couch our
behaviour in terms of the understanding that there is no permanence in
our life.  For example, I love my dog and kiss him every time I get the
chance, but I know full well that he will die one day just as I will and
the same for everybody else.</p>

mysticism</a>

weird.  I explain it in detail. ]</p>

<p>I balance my emotions with the requisite mysticism about the workings of
the cosmos.  I admit to the ephemeral nature of my self and all of its
underpinnings or predicates.  I acknowledge my multifaceted humanity,
meaning that I have emotions, reason, and a body.  I try to strike a
virtuous balance that grants me tranquillity (ataraxia) by aligning me
with the world: we are one.</p>

<p>The beard is no more.  So will everything else be gone.  Yet the cosmos
is ever-lasting, ever-present.  There is no existence from nothing, in
nothing, and towards nothing.  There will always be transfiguration.
Learn this and you will remain undisturbed in the lightness of your
being.</p>

      <p><strong>Update 2022-07-31 18:33 +0300:</strong> On rare occasions I
raise secondary points without explaining them: they don’t really
matter.  Though here I need to elaborate, otherwise there may be a
misunderstanding.  It is inferred from my writings—or stated
outright—that I have no interest in social standards and, as such,
the point about me being “uglier” is just part of my cynicism.
People would tell me that a long beard is not attractive and that I
should keep it trimmed, do this, do that…  To them, a natural long
beard is “ugly”, otherwise their exhortations to improve my looks
would be meaningless.  Then, there is the other view which holds
that facial hair is attractive only when it is a stubble.  As I had
just shaved, I had none.  There is a slur that people use, but I
will save you the trouble.  So again, per this inane standard, I am
“ugly”.  Then, if I were to just do what it takes to be “pretty”
with the facial hair, people would have more opinions about my hair,
clothing, accessories, and, and, and…  The gist is that either I
should ignore them by being confident and by letting them entertain
whatever notion they want (what I do), or yield to their pressure
and become an avatar of their expectations.  This is how things
stand.  Sometimes this cynic teases people to test their reflexes. <a href="#fnref:Ugliness" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">[^]</a></p>
