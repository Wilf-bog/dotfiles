<p>Under the motto &#8220;Who Cares&#8221; <a href="https://re-publica.com">Re:Publica</a> gathered a few thousand people in Berlin and I got to give a talk continuing the path I started out on with my last two talks in 2022 and 2023. Titled &#8220;<a href="https://re-publica.com/de/session/empty-innovation-what-are-we-even-doing">Empty Innovation</a>&#8221; I tried outlining my understanding of the patterns of the weird technological hypes we&#8217;ve gone through in the last years, why they happen and also what this mode of &#8220;innovation&#8221; does to us as people, communities and societies.</p>



<p>This time I actually asked to do it in English, not just to give all the native speakers something to giggle about but also because I thought that the talk might have a bit more legs after the fact. </p>
