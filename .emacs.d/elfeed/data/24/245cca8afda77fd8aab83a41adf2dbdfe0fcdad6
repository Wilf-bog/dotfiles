I stayed hidden, away from anybody's look, with that lingering thought of being completely wrong. I grew attached to my partner more than I would with any other human, and we spent a lot of time together. She was constantly giving either her back for pets that could continue for hours while I worked, or she was approaching her head asking for a kiss. As soon as I started having feel</span><span class="author-a-qz85zz83z4z76zz81zz68zz89zkz82z3z76zz72zsz71zt">ings</span><span class=""> for her, I had that dread in the back of my head.

If I can give you an</span><span class="author-a-qz85zz83z4z76zz81zz68zz89zkz82z3z76zz72zsz71zt">y</span><span class=""> advice, don't do that.

They brought a light in my dark thoughts. After talking for some time about dogs, they ended up showing interest in my way of thinking. The conversation branched toward more in depth relationship, and at some point they indirectly revealed their feelings toward dogs. In some sort, they came out to me first, making me realize that I wasn't alone, and after chatting for a bit I ended up coming out myself. </span><span class="author-a-qz85zz83z4z76zz81zz68zz89zkz82z3z76zz72zsz71zt">They gave me a word to describe something that I thought I was totally alone in feeling.</span><span class=""> Now that my world has been put upside down, I started searching online.

<div id="magicdomid18" class="ace-line" aria-live="assertive"><span class="">"It wasn't easy, that's for sure. I think I've always had some level of attraction to animals, and never for people.

<div id="magicdomid19" class="ace-line" aria-live="assertive"><span class="">She was a beautiful, loving, playful, and overall awesome individual, and she became my first crush.

<div id="magicdomid20" class="ace-line" aria-live="assertive"><span class="">On one hand, I just wanted the feelings to go away, but on the other, I wanted to be with her.

<div aria-live="assertive"> </div>
<div class="ace-line" aria-live="assertive"><span class="">Over a couple years, I met a few zoos, mostly on reddit. Some were simply fetishists, and made me feel worse about myself even though I was not like them. But others, others actually cared.</span></div>

<div id="magicdomid22" class="ace-line" aria-live="assertive"><span class="">Their love for animals was beyond just a sexual attraction. They wanted to do good for the animals in their lives, and actively did. This encouraged me to keep looking around.</span></div>
<div id="magicdomid23" class="ace-line" aria-live="assertive"><span class="">I eventually found zoocommunity.org and zooville, the former being a nice thing to check out, and see there's others like me out there (though I hated the forum format), and the latter being a breeding ground for sexual abuse and objectification of animals that only made me feel worse, knowing some would probably associate me with those kinds of people.</span></div>
<div aria-live="assertive"> </div>
<div id="magicdomid24" class="ace-line" aria-live="assertive"><span class="">What really sealed the deal is finding Zooey.pub, back in late 2023. I finally found a community of people who care, not only for animals, but for people like me, lost, scared, confused. It took me a while, but eventually I started to fit in on the discord server, and I've learned an incredible amount while making awesome friends along the way. At this point, I can confidently say that I'm a proud zoo, and no matter what strangers say I'll always love animals, and especially my girl."</span></div>

For people like that, where you just get the vibe really strong, you can try and see if you can point them in the right direction. It's just complicated when you know them in real life. Thankfully, there are lots of bits and pieces of media starting to poke their way into society that aren't made by zoos.

You could send them the really amazing Journal of Controversial Ideas article about how bestiality is morally permissible and get their thoughts on that. There are lots of non-zoo ways to just feel it out. And that can be a great conversation starting point if they trust you enough to come out to you, or just plant the seed in their head that they aren't alone, and that it's okay to think about this kinda thing."</span></div>

It's not about pushing them in a direction, it's about making them learn.

Also don't be too sexual or pushy with the "you must be a zoophile, accept it!" - share your feelings and experiences and explain what your love for animals means to you, listen to their experiences and thoughts as well, and you'll likely discover you have a lot in common already, and that you understand each other well on topics like animal equality and care or that you're able to have awesome thoughtful conversations about the things you view differ</span><span class="author-a-c0vz84zdfksl3z65zz77zz85z50z89z">e</span><span class="">ntly"</span></div>

But a lot of people really struggle with learning they're a zoo. A lot of people really hate themselves over it deep down in their soul. That's not something you're going to fix by just saying the right words one time and then leaving them be. Give them space, and the room they need to breathe. Don't try and push them into anything. You can help guide them when they have questions, or are ready to take another step, but anything more than that and you can very easily end up scaring them off or making them hate themselves more."</span></div>
