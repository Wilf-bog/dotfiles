<p>In this video I continue my commentary on the book <em>Dao De Jing</em> by
the ancient Chinese philosopher Lao Zi.  I expound on the relationship
between a form and its instantiation.  My comments are not an
interpretation of the words found in the book, but rather my thoughts
on topics that are related to those covered by Lao Zi.</p>
