FSFâ€™s <em>Working Together</em> series.  Here it is:
<a href="https://www.fsf.org/working-together/profiles/prot">https://www.fsf.org/working-together/profiles/prot</a>.</p>

<p>The accompanying article, titled <a href="https://www.fsf.org/blogs/community/the-campaigns-team-and-the-community-work-together-for-free-software">The campaigns team and the community
work together for free software</a>, states thus:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Next, we hear from fellow <a href="https://www.fsf.org/news/free-software-awards-winners-announced-securepairs-protesilaos-stavrou-paul-eggert">Free Software
Award</a>
winner <a href="https://www.fsf.org/working-together/profiles/prot">Protesilaos
Stavrou</a> on what
motivates his work on GNU Emacs. In addition to his prolific writing
and recorded introductory GNU Emacs materials, Prot is the developer
of the Denote and Logos packages, as well as the Modus and Ef color
themes. As Prot is a relative newcomer to free software development
and the free software movement, his work shows how much a dedicated
beginner can learn and accomplish in a short amount of time.</p>
