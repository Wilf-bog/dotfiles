
<h1>&#8216;L&#8217;Écume Des Mots&#8217; (The Foam of Words) is the latest single from French artist, musician, and composer Ludovic Gerst, known as Frise Lumière.</h1>
<hr />
<p>By focusing solely on his bass, he creates rhythmic, harmonic, and percussive melodies. Released on July 18, the single is available on all digital platforms and serves as the opening track for his upcoming album &#8216;Ambo.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;Foam is the whitish foam formed on the surface of the sea by the agitation of waves or by the meeting of currents. In this track, I wanted to highlight the words that may have been expressed against us, words that some people consider irrelevant to themselves. Sometimes words that are simply not expressed or explained, words that can leave certain visible or invisible traces on us in our everyday lives. &#8220;</p>
