<p>Just published an essay titled <a href="https://protesilaos.com/nature-convention-aromantic/">On the nature-convention
divide</a> and
subtitled “With aromanticism as a case study”.  This is a work on
ontology and related epistemics concerned with the distinction between
pragmata and chrēmata in the particular case of human nature.
Aromanticism is offered as a tangible example for the sake of not
appearing too abstract.</p>
