<p>In this video I explain what has transpired since my last vlog entry,
which was <a href="https://protesilaos.com/news/2022-11-07-job-help-cv-story/">my public plea for help in finding a
job</a>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>I have a short-term project to work on.  It is related to Emacs.  I
will publish more about it in the near future on my websiteâ€™s coding
blog section.</li>
  <li>This small job pays some money that I will use for the next few
weeks.  It gives me a modicum of stability.</li>
  <li>I also received some donations.  Again, they provide some immediate
relief.</li>
  <li>The underlying problem is the same: I need a job and I will have to
relocate.  But now I am not desperate to accept the first offer that
comes my way.</li>
  <li>I do not want to adopt a decision about my future under extreme
duress.  It has to be something I will not regret.</li>
  <li>I started learning Clojure and I explain why I picked it over
Python, JavaScript, Ruby, and Common Lisp.  In short: (i) there is
sufficient demand for it, (ii) it provides a Lisp conduit to the
worlds of Java and JavaScript, (iii) the members of the community
who contacted me are very passionate about this language, which
excites me.</li>
  <li>I think Clojure has this Emacs-y quality where the members of its
community care about the qualitative aspects of their craft.  At
least based on the feedback I received.</li>
  <li>I am reading books and am setting up Emacs with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">clojure-mode</code> and
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cider</code>.  The plan is to start writing real code, like toy programs,
which will help me understand how things work in practice.</li>
  <li>I explain what I learnt about my CV and how the tech industry does
not care so much about formal qualifications.  I still rely on the
human factor though.</li>
  <li>Brief comment on all the messages I have received and how I am still
replying to each of them.  It takes time.</li>
  <li>Some words about offers I cannot accept.</li>
  <li>Closing thoughts with a philosophical point about not relying on
appearances.</li>
</ul>
