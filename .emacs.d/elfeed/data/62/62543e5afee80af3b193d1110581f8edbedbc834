<p>Finished reading: <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781786583253">Days at the Morisaki Bookshop</a> by Satoshi Yagisawa ðŸ“š</p>
<p>This made me want to visit <a href="https://en.jimbou.info/">Kanda Jimbochu</a>, the second-hand  bookstore quarter of Tokyo, where the novel is set. Perhaps itâ€™s a bit of a tourist trap, but hey, books!</p>
<p>The story is a little thin, but then just yesterday I heard an amazing <em>true</em> story about a book shop, that would sound unbelievable if it was ever put in a novel - so maybe this experience has set the bar a little high.</p>
