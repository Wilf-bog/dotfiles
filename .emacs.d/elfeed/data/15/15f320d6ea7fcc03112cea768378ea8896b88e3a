<div style="text-align: left;" align="center"><em>Son Cesano</em>&#8216;s second album is a dreamy instrumental journey, just like their debut album Submerge, but as the title suggests, it is lighter, wider and more free.</div>
<div style="text-align: left;" align="center"><strong>The songs take us with them, while they develop through all kinds of different stages, opening up vast atmospheric realms for us to explore.</strong></div>
<div style="text-align: left;" align="center">We find a well-balanced mix of jammy and proggy, and strong contrasts from dark to bright, which nicely resembles the album&#8217;s theme.</div>

<h3 style="text-align: center;">How&#8217;s The Sound?</h3>
<p><strong>The trip starts with a vibrant first song, &#8216;Monus Bonus&#8217; builds up the energy that we need to lift us away from the clutches of gravity. </strong></p>
<p>Now that we float freely, &#8216;The Nordic One&#8217; sets us on an emotional course through inner space. Don&#8217;t be afraid to shed a little tear on the way, because the destination is warm and forgivingly heavy.</p>
<p>&#8216;The Mystic Four&#8217; comes very gentle and optimistic like after facing our emotions, we are able to see much clearer where the road can go &#8211; and then we truly start exploring.</p>
<p>&#8216;Ruskial&#8217; is the most playful track on the album,<strong> it really lets the mind loose until we end up in a completely different world</strong>, asking ourselves how did we get here?</p>
<p>&#8216;Pos. T&#8217; feels like a turning point. <strong>As we soar over endless deserts, the vibes are getting obscurer and ultimately point toward the heavy ending.</strong></p>
<p>But before that, there is one last puzzle to solve for us. &#8216;6. Akt&#8217; is more on the cerebral side, the sound is cold and clear, forming mountains of ice, and crushing them in the end.</p>
<p>For the finale, we deserve at least a slow-motion sunset on planet mercury, don&#8217;t you think? And that&#8217;s exactly what we get &#8211; <strong>the last song &#8216;Hardangial&#8217; wraps us in calm, giving the album a strong finish, that leaves no one unsatisfied.</strong></p>
