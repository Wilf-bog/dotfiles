<p>In this ~50-minute video I talk about the philosophical theme of
diversity with masculinity as a case in point. Some of the main
points:</p>

<ul>
  <li>How art captures patterns of everyday behaviour to turn them into
archetypes. Those help us understand profound insights in a
relatable way.</li>
  <li>Discussion about the archetype of Achilles: the champion who fought
in the Trojan War (reference to the relevant art).</li>
  <li>How Achilles is as relevant as ever with regard to discourses about
masculinity and how men “should” be.</li>
  <li>We can find the Achilles type in the form of the influencer who
prompts his audience to be forceful.</li>
  <li>Why exceptional skills do not justify one being arrogant and
intolerant towards others.</li>
  <li>Achilles is not the only type of man. Even within a single gender,
there are many types.</li>
  <li>The case of Odysseus, another hero of the Trojan War, and how there
can be different types of man.</li>
  <li>How modern-day narratives discount the diversity even within a
single gender. This encourages once group of men to bully other men.</li>
  <li>Comments on how Odysseus differs from Achilles in terms of dealing
with challenges. Sometimes you do not just power through; sometimes
you have to work around.</li>
  <li>The case of Odysseus and the Cyclops. This is an example of not
trying to solve everything with brute force, as that is foolish.</li>
  <li>There is nothing wrong with being strong. The problem is when we are
trying to create a monoculture among men.</li>
  <li>Instead of recognising how things stand, we are quick to judge them.</li>
  <li>I don’t think there is anything wrong with some elements of advice,
such as exercising. But if we make that the be-all-end-all of
manhood, there starts the problem. It breeds intolerance towards the
fact that there are other activities as well; other types of man.</li>
  <li>Personal stories where men try to play tough.</li>
  <li>How being pretentious is bad for you and your relationships.</li>
  <li>Connecting the dots in all the aforementioned.</li>
  <li>Explaining discipline as opposed to obedience and conformity.</li>
  <li>The archetype of Athena, the goddess of wisdom, and what it
symbolises.</li>
</ul>
