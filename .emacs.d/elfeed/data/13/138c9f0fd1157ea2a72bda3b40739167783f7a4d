<p>A few weeks ago I was asked if I want to be nominated for the FSF
board.  This is a position that involves voluntary work in pursuit of
the ends of the foundation for the advancement of software freedom.  I
agreed to participate in the process and am eager to contribute to the
cause however I can.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.fsf.org/news/announcing-the-fsfs-board-candidates">announcement on the FSF website</a>
lists the nominees and then outlines the next steps:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[…] FSF associate members will ascertain the candidates’ commitment
to the fundamental requirements of the FSF mission, identify valuable
attributes listed in the <a href="https://www.fsf.org/about/staff-and-board/board-matrix/">board matrix</a>,
gauge whether the candidates will help the board fulfill its <a href="https://www.fsf.org/about/the-role-of-the-fsfs-board-of-directors">overall
role</a>
in the Foundation, and whether they will fulfill a board member’s
<a href="https://www.fsf.org/about/board-member-agreement">individual duties</a>
in accordance with the <a href="https://www.fsf.org/about/board-of-directors-code-of-ethics">board code of ethics</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There will be more follow.  Good luck to everyone.  May the greater
good be prioritised!</p>
