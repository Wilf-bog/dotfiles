<p><a href="https://ericgregorich.com/2024/04/27/is-the-web.html">Is the web falling apart?</a>, Eric Gregorich wonders.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Manuel Moreale is confident that <a href="https://manuelmoreale.com/the-web-is-not-dying">the web is not dying</a>.</p>
<p>I agree with both of them. These views aren&rsquo;t contradictory. Falling apart is what the Web does best. It&rsquo;s been falling apart since it started, and reconfiguring itself too.</p>
<p>Google search used to control and shape the web. Because everyone just Googled their searches, websites all used Search Engine Optimization in a vicious circle of conformity. But that&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.techspot.com/news/102765-who-prabhakar-raghavan-why-accused-killing-google-search.html">finally</a> <a href="https://www.inc-aus.com/minda-zetlin/with-10-words-google-head-of-search-prabhakar-raghavan-just-taught-a-profound-lesson-about-success.html">changing</a>.</p>
<p>Search gets degraded by advertising greed on one side and AI tools are generating drivel on the other. Both are examples of what Ed Zitron calls <a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/the-rot-economy/">the rot economy</a>.</p>
<p>So how can good material rise to the surface?</p>
<p>In part it&rsquo;s a return to the old ways. <a href="https://www.manton.org/2024/03/11/recommendations-and-blogrolls.html">Blogrolls</a> and <a href="https://xn--sr8hvo.ws/">webrings</a> and <a href="https://github.com/AboutRSS/ALL-about-RSS">RSS</a> are having a mini-revival and it&rsquo;s not entirely mere nostalgia. One-person search engines like <a href="https://search.marginalia.nu/">Marginalia</a> are having a moment, as are <a href="https://searx.space/">metasearch engines</a> and other <a href="https://escapethealgorithm.substack.com/p/folk-search-engines">&lsquo;folk&rsquo; search</a> strategies. I like little experiments like <a href="https://a-website-is-a-room.net/">A Website Is A Room</a>.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s my tip: to find <a href="https://micro.blog/discover/books/grid">interesting books</a>, <a href="https://micro.blog/discover/quotes">great quotes</a>, and <a href="https://micro.blog/discover/podcasts">intriguing podcasts</a>, more people should know about <a href="https://micro.blog/discover">micro.blog Discover</a>!</p>
