<p>Just another quick status update on my hut building project.  I need
to start a fire to burn the accumulated mass of dry leaves and bushes.
But I must first gain access to some water from a stream a few hundred
metres away.  I will keep the water just as a precaution.  The
temperatures are still low in the mountains: we practically still are
at the end of winter season.</p>
