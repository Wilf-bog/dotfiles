for Emacs.  It uses the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">page-delimiter</code> (typically the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">^L</code>
character) or the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">outline-regexp</code> together with some commands to move
between pages whether narrowing is in effect or not.  It also provides
some optional stylistic tweaks which come into effect when the
buffer-local <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">logos-focus-mode</code> is enabled.  The manual shows how to
extend the code to achieve the desired result.</p>

<p>Below are the release notes.</p>

<hr />

<h2>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">logos-focus-mode-extra-functions</code> has a new name</h2>

<p>It is now called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">logos-focus-mode-hook</code> to conform with the
conventions surrounding Emacs Lisp packaging.  The old name is
deprecated and will be removed in the future.  The relevant warnings
are in place to inform users of the change.</p>

<p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">logos-focus-mode-extra-functions</code> had the unfortunate connotation
of being an irregular hook, i.e. one that runs with arguments.
Whereas this one is a regular hook that passes no arguments to the
functions it calls.  Quoting from the Emacs Lisp Reference Manual:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If the hook variable’s name does not end with ‘-hook’, that indicates
it is probably an “abnormal hook”.  These differ from normal hooks in
two ways: they can be called with one or more arguments, and their
return values can be used in some way.  The hook’s documentation says
how the functions are called and how their return values are used.  Any
functions added to an abnormal hook must follow the hook’s calling
convention.  By convention, abnormal hook names end in ‘-functions’.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To read the manual, evaluate this inside of Emacs:</p>

<div class="language-elisp highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">info</span> <span class="s">"(elisp) Hooks"</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">logos-page-delimiter</code> variable/function is now public</h2>

<p>Renaming the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">logos-page-delimiter</code> function and variable is necessary
as both can safely be included in user-defined code.</p>

<p>In the context of Elisp packaging, a “private” symbol is denoted by a
double dash in its name.  Such code is intended for internal use: it
may be redefined or altogether removed without further notice.
Whereas a “public” symbol comes with the implicit guarantee that the
developer will take good care to preserve its behaviour and/or
document any breaking changes.</p>

<h2>Functions that set state have a more descriptive name</h2>

<p>This concerns <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">logos--mode</code>, hereby renamed to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">logos-set-mode-arg</code>,
and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">logos--set</code>, which is now called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">logos-set-buffer-local-value</code>.</p>

<p>The intent is to make the code public as well as to better describe
what it does already at the naming level.</p>

<p>As always, the relevant arrangements are in place to notify users of
the change.</p>

<h2>The Git repository also includes a README.md</h2>

<p>The project has a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">README.org</code> file which contains the project’s
documentation and is exported to the Info page format.  A new
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">README.md</code> is supplied as well to provide the basics of what <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">logos</code>
is, link to its video demo, and further resources.</p>

<p>Thanks to Dave Abrahams for asking me to put a video demo in the
README.  This inspired me to update this repository to be in the style
of the others I also maintain.  Dave’s comment was made in issue 12 on
the GitHub mirror: <a href="https://github.com/protesilaos/logos/issues/12">https://github.com/protesilaos/logos/issues/12</a>.</p>
