<p>I published a new essay on philosophy: <a href="https://protesilaos.com/scepticism-certitude/">Scepticism as a type of
certitude</a>.  It explores the probl√©matique of
whether scepticism is a kind of certainty and, if so, how to
differentiate between different statements that are made in certitude.</p>
