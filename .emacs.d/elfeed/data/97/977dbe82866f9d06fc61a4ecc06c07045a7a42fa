<p><strong>UPDATE 2021-12-17 10:29 +0200:</strong> The section is now called “General
commentary on life”.  Please refer to <a href="https://protesilaos.com/news/2021-12-17-rename-advice-section-commentary/">the
announcement</a></p>

<hr />

<p>I just created a new section on my website, which contains my answers to
questions I received about general life issues:
<a href="https://protesilaos.com/advice">https://protesilaos.com/advice</a>.  It also has a <a href="https://protesilaos.com/advice.xml">dedicated RSS
feed</a>.</p>

<p>As I note in the new section’s index page:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I often reply to emails and later think to myself: “hey, this might be
interest to a wider audience”. If you ever wish to ask me a question
about general life issues and have it published here without any
identifying information, please <a href="https://protesilaos.com/contact">contact
me</a> .</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The first post I have published there concerns the frame of mind we
ought to have in assessing the end and the means used to pursue it.  The
case in point concerns university studies and the prospects of a career:
