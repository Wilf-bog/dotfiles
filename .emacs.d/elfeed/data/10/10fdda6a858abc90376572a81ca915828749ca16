<p><strong>UPDATE 2022-11-12 07:49 +0200</strong>: Read <a href="https://protesilaos.com/news/2022-11-12-job-status-update/">the status update on my job
search</a>.
In short, nothing to show for yet.</p>

<hr />

<p>This video is my public plea to find employment.  It comes with an
explanation of why I am in this situation and why my CV is
underwhelming/useless.</p>

<p>This is a follow-up to the announcement I made on Saturday about
finding a job and relocating:

<p>If you know of an employer who can put faith in me and help me get
started, please put me in contact with them.  <strong>Any job</strong> that pays
the bills will suffice, as I also explained in my previous
publication.</p>

<p>I have no-one to vouch for me and no formal certification that
improves my chances or otherwise flatters me.  I can only trust in the
human factor.</p>

<p>If you cannot help, donâ€™t worry about it: I am prepared for all
possible outcomes and understand the implications.</p>
