<p>On 2021-11-06, I created a new section on my website which I described
as being about “life advice” (read <a href="https://protesilaos.com/news/2021-11-06-new-section-life-advice/">the
announcement</a>).
I now realise this was a poor choice of words, as it can give the
impression that there is a relationship between some master and a
student or, else, between unequal parties.  Such was never my intention:
I am no master, no expert, no guru or whatever, and have no intention to
be considered in those terms.  I just speak my mind.  So please accept
my apologies!</p>

<p>The section is now titled “General commentary on life”.  All URLs have
been edited to omit the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/advice</code> path and instead point to
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/commentary</code>.  Redicects have been installed accordingly, so users
visiting an old link should be taken to its new destination.</p>

<p>However, it is likely that the old RSS feed is broken and users will
have to manually update their sources.  The old URL was:
<a href="https://protesilaos.com/advice.xml">https://protesilaos.com/advice.xml</a>.  The new one must be:
<a href="https://protesilaos.com/commentary.xml">https://protesilaos.com/commentary.xml</a>.</p>
