announcement of the new feature.</p>

<p>Denote is a simple note-taking tool for Emacs.  It is based on the idea
that notes should follow a predictable and descriptive file-naming
scheme.  The file name must offer a clear indication of what the note is
about, without reference to any other metadata.  Denote basically
streamlines the creation of such files while providing facilities to
link between them.</p>

<p>Denote’s file-naming scheme is not limited to “notes”.  It can be used
for all types of file, including those that are not editable in Emacs,
such as videos.  Naming files in a constistent way makes their
filtering and retrieval considerably easier.  Denote provides relevant
facilities to rename files, regardless of file type.</p>

<p>Signatures are an optional extension to Denote’s file-naming scheme.
They are arbitrary strings of alphanumerical characters that can be
used to establish sequential relations between files at the level of
their file name (e.g. 1, 1a, 1b, 1b1, 1b2, …).</p>

<p>Files that have the signature follow this scheme (though read the
documentation of ‘denote-prompts’ for possible permutations):</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>DATE==SIGNATURE--TITLE__KEYWORDS.EXTENSION
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>As a reminder, Denote’s default file-naming scheme is:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>DATE--TITLE__KEYWORDS.EXTENSION
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>[ Denote can be used to rename any file, not just to create notes.  As
  such, the file-naming scheme is a powerful, yet low-tech invention
  to facilitate searching and filtering. ]</p>

<p>For the time being, signatures are not added to a file’s front matter
and are not shown anywhere else beside the file name.  This is done on
purpose to simplify the implementation and make sure we define clear
use-cases for this feature (it is easier to add new functionality than
refactor/break existing one).</p>

<p>Users can create files with signatures either by (i) modifying the
‘denote-prompts’ user option to affect the standard ‘denote’ command,
or (ii) by generating such files on demand with the command
‘denote-signature’ (alias ‘denote-create-note-using-signature’).</p>

<p>Signatures are treated as quasi-identifiers when renaming files that
include them.  This means that they are not touched by Denote.  The
user must manually update the signature which, in theory, should not
be done if notes already have a predefined sequence.</p>

<p>Signatures are backward-compatible, meaning that existing users are
not impacted by their inclusion.</p>

<p>The signature extension was discussed at length on the GitHub mirror
in issue 115: <a href="https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/issues/115">https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/issues/115</a>.
Thanks to Stefan Thesing, Mirko Hernandez, Noboru Ota (nobiot),
Xiaoxing Hu, nbehrnd, Elias Storms, and 101scholar for helping me
reason about this feature, understand its scope, and prototype its
implementation.</p>

<p>The inclusion of the ‘signature’ branch into ‘main’ does not mean that
we are done with the development of this feature.  We are simply
making it available to more users while preparing for the release of
version <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">2.0.0</code> of Denote.</p>

<p>Watch the video series “Denote as a Zettelkasten” produced by Stefan
Thesing, which makes use of these signatures:
