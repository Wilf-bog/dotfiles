<p><strong>UPDATE 2021-08-27 15:27 +0300:</strong> I am back with a new desktop
computer.  More to follow in newer publications.</p>

<hr />

<p>About ten days ago <a href="https://protesilaos.com/news/2021-08-05-laptop-battery/">my laptop’s battery stopped
recharging</a>.
The machine cannot work without it even if I keep it plugged, so I have
not had a personal computer ever since.</p>

<p>Now I am writing this from the office of the local commune:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>While there are over 700+ messages in my inbox, I noticed several
donations over the past few days.  The amount I have received is a bit
over <strong>EUR 430</strong>.  Wow!  That is more than I have received in all of
the previous years combined!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not know how that happened and will reply to each person once I
get the chance.  Though I must first regain access to Emacs+Notmuch,
otherwise the email correspondence is not manageable.  All I can do at
this point is thank everyone and promise to do my best once I’m
available.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was searching for battery replacements and was disappointed with my
findings.  No local provider has any, while online offers, such as on
ebay, have exorbitant shipping costs (e.g. EUR 40-60 for the battery
and over EUR 100 to send it to Cyprus).  That would cost more than the
laptop itself.  Also, I read that not all batteries are made equal in
terms of reliability.  It is risky.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The donation money changes my plan A: I will search for hardware to
either build a desktop computer or buy a mini tower.  Whatever is
available here.  I am not particularly knowledgeable about computer
components and will need to learn more before committing to any
option.  If this does not yield results, I will go with the plan B of
buying a battery.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Hopefully I will be back in action within the next 3 weeks.  Unless
something major changes, I will not post a new announcement but will
just edit this one instead.  That is because I will get back to
publishing what I usually do: I have written a couple of manuscripts
already and would like to do at least one new Emacs-related video.</p>
