<p>The <a href="https://protesilaos.com/news/">news and announcements</a> section of my website will be used to share information about my work that falls outside the scope of my existing blogs (politics, coding, â€¦). For example, when I publish my next book, I will post the relevant details here.</p>

<p>There is a <a href="/news.xml">corresponding RSS feed</a> to help you keep track of the occasional update.</p>

<p>If unsure, refer to the <a href="https://protesilaos.com/feeds/">feeds</a> page for information about RSS feeds and available content indices/streams on <em>protesilaos.com</em>.</p>

<p>If still unsure, <a href="https://protesilaos.com/contact/">contact me</a>.</p>
