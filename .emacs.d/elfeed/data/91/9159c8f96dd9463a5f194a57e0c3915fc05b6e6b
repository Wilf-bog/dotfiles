         
         <p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ef-themes</code> are a collection of light and dark themes for GNU
Emacs that provide colourful (“pretty”) yet legible options for users
who want something with a bit more flair than the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">modus-themes</code> (also
designed by me).</p>

<p>Below are the release notes.</p>

<hr />

<p>This version contains minor refinements for many of the themes in the
collection. It also introduces two new themes which, according to
private feedback I have received, are already well received.</p>

<h2>Experience the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ef-dream</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ef-reverie</code> themes</h2>

<p>Both themes revolve around the use of gold tones and subtle
complementary colours.</p>

<p>I announced them here: <a href="https://protesilaos.com/codelog/2024-04-09-emacs-ef-dream-reverie-themes/">https://protesilaos.com/codelog/2024-04-09-emacs-ef-dream-reverie-themes/</a>.</p>

<p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ef-themes</code> now cover a wide range of tastes, all while conforming
with a high legibility standard (minimum WCAG AA, though many qualify
for WCAG AAA).</p>

<h2>Refinements for some themes</h2>

<p>These are small changes that improve the consistency of the given
theme.</p>

<h3>ef-bio</h3>

<p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">preprocessor</code> semantic palette mapping uses a cyan-green colour
instead of a vibrant green. This is to better differentiate elements
in code, while remaining faithful to the style of the theme.</p>

<h3>ef-cyprus</h3>

<p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">preprocessor</code> semantic palette mapping is redefined from a faint
yellow to a firebrick red. This is to ensure that the various
combinations of elements in code are easy to tell apart while
remaining pleasant to look at.</p>

<h3>ef-day</h3>

<p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">green-faint</code> value has reduced contribution from the blue channel
of light, making it more green-yellow as a result. This colour is only
used for comments: it achieves the two-fold goal of (i) applying
subtle colouration to comments while (ii) making them sufficiently
distinct from their context.</p>

<h3>ef-dark</h3>

<p>The value of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">preprocessor</code> is a bit darker red than its former
brighter variant. This is to improve the visuals in files that include
a high concentration of preprocessor constructs.</p>

<h3>ef-duo-light</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cyan-warmer</code> entry in the palette is a bit less blue and more
green. The change is imperceptible on its own (from <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">#3f6faf</code> to
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">#3f70a0</code>). The effect is more noticeable in the context of other
constructs, such as in an Org document that combines headings of
varying levels, with code and verbatim inline elements, as well as
links.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">comment</code> semantic palette mapping uses a slightly more orange
value. This is done for stylistic consistency with the rest of the
theme, while making comments a bit easier to spot.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>ef-duo-dark</h3>

<p>As with its light counterpart, the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">comment</code> entry in the palette uses
a slightly different colour value. The effect is subtle and only
appreciated in context.</p>

<h3>ef-frost</h3>

<p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">yellow-faint</code> palette entry is considerably more yellow than its
previous value. The reason for this change is to make comments and
tags in Org headings stand out more when compared to some other subtle
elements. The exact value of this yellow still feels ice-cold, like
the rest of the theme.</p>

<h3>ef-kassio</h3>

<p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">comment</code> semantic palette mapping uses a slightly more cyan
value. Comments are easier to tell apart from their context, while
retaining the spirit of their original design.</p>

<h3>ef-light</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">blue</code> entry in the palette is darker than before. This makes
the links it is applied to easier to spot in their context.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">blue-faint</code> is a bit less purple/indigo than before. It is now
applied to level 1 headings (such as in Org) instead of the previous
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">blue</code> value. Combined with the above it makes it easier to
differentiate various elements that are rendered in some shade of
blue (like Org verbatim and links).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">preprocessor</code> semantic palette mapping uses a slightly darker
red than before, to better fit in with the rest of the theme.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>ef-melissa-light</h3>

<p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">red-warmer</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">red-cooler</code>, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">yellow</code> palette entries are
revised in concert to (i) retain the overall balance of the theme
while (ii) making those colours easier to tell apart.</p>

<h3>ef-rosa</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Links use a different shade of green. It makes for a slightly better
fit in the context of other elements.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">green</code> value is less saturated. It better complements the
colours it is combined with, such as pink and magenta.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mail-subject</code> semantic palette mapping uses the aforementioned
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">green</code>, as it makes for a better fit in that context.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">comment</code> semantic palette mapping has a faint green value.
Comments are a bit easier to spot, while they better contribute to
the aesthetics of the theme.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>ef-summer</h3>

<p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">preprocessor</code> semantic palette mapping has a shade of green that
has greater contribution from the blue channel of light. The first
impression is the same as before, though the exact value is a better
fit for the theme.</p>

<h3>ef-symbiosis</h3>

<p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">preprocessor</code> semantic palette mapping is less intense than
before to make sure there is no impression of exaggeration when there
is a high concentration of it on the screen.</p>

<h2>All light themes use slightly different graph colours</h2>

<p>This is a subset of the palette that is used in some special cases
such as the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">org-habit</code> consistency graph. The change covers the
lighter green and blue values, which are now easier to spot in their
context.</p>

<h2>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">doom-modeline</code> no longer uses <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bold-italic</code></h2>

<p>There were two instances where the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bold-italic</code> face was applied.
This could break icons, by clipping their top. We revert to only using
the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bold</code> face.</p>

<p>Thanks to Filippo Argiolas for bringing this matter to my attention in
issue 42: <a href="https://github.com/protesilaos/ef-themes/issues/42">https://github.com/protesilaos/ef-themes/issues/42</a>.</p>
