<p>In this ~50-minute video I read some passages from the Analects of
Confucius and provide my thoughts on them. In overview:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Avoiding the trap of overthinking. We want to be acting and be
learning things that we have a use for.</li>
  <li>How to do things in earnest and try to be the best version of
yourself.</li>
  <li>What it means to be the embodiment of your values, instead of merely
advertising what you believe in.</li>
  <li>Comments on honour and credibility.</li>
</ul>
