<p>Attached at the bottom of this post is a link to the Table of Contents and the full, comprehensive introduction (virtually a book in itself) I wrote for the book, <em>Academic Repression: Reflections from the Academic-Industrial Complex</em> (AK Press, 2010). Published a decade ago, the book is a bit dated, but its themes &#8212; repression of free speech, conservative hegemony, suppression of radical viewpoints in academia, the corporatization of universities, the dismantling of the tenure system and exploitation of cheap labor Â &#8212; certainly are not. Academic repression is alive and well today. The full text of the book is available <a href="https://www.akpress.org/academic-repression-reflections-from-the-academic-industrial-complex.html">here</a>.</p>
