Did you know that this online magazine of ours, Zooey Dot Pub, is actually a community magazine</span><span class="author-a-pz71zvcbs5dhsm0z122zrz89z3">?</span><span class=""> That's right! As much as this might seem like "Tarro rants about things and sometimes makes zoo references" in the style of an early 2000s blog, in fact this is actually something much more! When asked about the magazine, I really like to compare it to a town square, or a soap box. It's a platform open for anyone to use (with some moderation of course) to present their ideas to a wider audience. It's a way to talk directly to the zoo community, the haters, or to the wider world at large. We want to be a megaphone, amplifying your voice to everyone! </span></div>

<div id="magicdomid4" class="ace-line" aria-live="assertive"><span class="">And yet, not a lot of people actually do end up writing articles. Which is fine! You certainly don't have to! We love our dear readers after all! But sometimes I'll talk to people who say that they want to write an article, but they can't. That might be for a number of reasons. Maybe they don't feel like they know how to write, maybe they don't have an idea, maybe they aren't sure what the best way to go about it is. Well, today's article is meant to devoid those people of all of their excuses! I want to go over the process of writing an article from start to finish. That way, I (selfishly) can use this as a resource anytime anyone asks how, but also in hopes that you can see just how easy it really is, and hopefully inspire some people to try slamming some keys and writing something of their own! </span></div>

I'm sure that if you're a gamer, you can think about a game that you like that has animals in it, and you can examine the ways that those animals are treated. Hell, if you wanted, instead of focusing on a single game you could do a whole overview of how animals are treated in games, or in media in general. Who's doing well, who's doing poorly, what would you like to see from the industry in general? Or, if you for some reason don't like any games with animals in them, you could look at a more sociological view of the game. Is there an oppressed minority in the game subjugated for something that they can't control</span><span class="author-a-pz71zvcbs5dhsm0z122zrz89z3">?</span><span class=""> Obviously there's a lot of reasons that people have been treated unfairly across all of gaming, but it might make an interesting article to talk about revolution, and the way that the heroes of that game are able to overcome that oppression, and what we can take away from that story for our own struggles. </span></div>

<div id="magicdomid83" class="ace-line" aria-live="assertive"><span class="">And bam, just like that, you've got an outline for a really great article! From here, you would go through point by point and really flesh everything out. Give it the bulk, add some more details, some jokes, whatever stylings you'd like to make the article read great. This is a really really fantastic way to write articles. Think of it like an artist doing linework before inking.

While fiction is a bit of a different beast, </span><span class="author-a-pz71zvcbs5dhsm0z122zrz89z3">many</span><span class=""> authors start with some kind of plot layout where they line up the beats of the story, and then start to flesh it out from there. Also, just because you're following a formula doesn't mean you have to always stick to the script! As you get better at writing, you can adapt this method to a ton of new options. Maybe you want to start with the conclusion and work backwards, maybe you want to dive right into point one first, and then explain the intro stuff afterwards. Maybe you want to tell a framed perspective where each point is accompanied by its own intro and outro. All of those are super valid, and also can still fit with trying to use this method of writing.</span></div>

<div id="magicdomid86" class="ace-line" aria-live="assertive"></div>
<div id="magicdomid87" class="ace-line" aria-live="assertive"><span class="">That said, particularly attentive reader will have noticed that I said there are two kinds of writers when I was first broaching this topic. The second, lovingly referred to as a "pantser</span><span class="author-a-pz71zvcbs5dhsm0z122zrz89z3">,</span><span class="">" as in "by the seat of your pants</span><span class="author-a-pz71zvcbs5dhsm0z122zrz89z3">,</span><span class="">" is the kind of writer who doesn't use any planning and instead writes by </span><span class="author-a-pz71zvcbs5dhsm0z122zrz89z3">Naruto running into the metaphorical dark</span><span class="">. Basically, the idea is that you have what you want to say in your head, and you just sit down and write. This is a fantastic method for some people! But, it too has its upsides and downsides. Let's start with the ups. </span></div>
<div aria-live="assertive"> </div>
<div id="magicdomid88" class="ace-line" aria-live="assertive"></div>
<div id="magicdomid89" class="ace-line" aria-live="assertive"><span class="">First, it feels very much like the "better" way to do it, in terms of skill and time efficiency. If you don't need to do a framework and you can just crank out content it's theoretically much easier to fly through it. It can also sometimes lead to a text that feels more emotionally concise and together. If you're in the same frame of mind the whole time you're writing things can just naturally flow better, as opposed to if you start, stop and then start up again but you're in a different mental state.</span></div>
<div id="magicdomid90" class="ace-line" aria-live="assertive"></div>
<div aria-live="assertive"> </div>
<div id="magicdomid91" class="ace-line" aria-live="assertive"><span class="">There are also some big downsides though. First of all, this style of writing is like sprinting. You hit the ground running and go as fast and hard as you can to get to the end. But what happens if you start running and you're going in the wrong direction? This method makes it really easy to run into dead ends where you're forced to stop and realize that what you're writing isn't leading anywhere. This is especially true for new authors who think this is the only way to write. You dig yourself into a hole, and because you never really knew where you were going in the first place it makes it really hard to course correct. Speaking of which, this style of writing is also generally much harder to make revisions to. If you write out a whole article, but then realize that point three is kinda weak because everything is so interconnected having to rewrite that section can make it really stand out. I know I'm coming down on this style much harder than I did the other, but I know this is what everyone wants to do</span><span class="author-a-pz71zvcbs5dhsm0z122zrz89z3"> at some point in their writing journey</span><span class="">, and I just want to make it clear that in the grand scheme of things, unless you sit down and write a perfect article the first time with no roadblocks at all, it takes just as much time if not longer to write this way, since problems are so much more complicated to get around.</span></div>

<div id="magicdomid93" class="ace-line" aria-live="assertive"><span class="">At the end of the day, there are tons and tons of other styles of writing as well, these just tend to be the most common, and I wanted to showcase them both so that you have the options. </span></div>

If you land a perfect swoosh from the get go that's awesome, but if it's going to hit the rim and bounce off we're there to redirect it. Our goal is to make sure that your message comes out as effectively and as powerfully as possible. </span></div>

<div id="magicdomid166" class="ace-line" aria-live="assertive"><span class="">As far as editing goes, we use a very cool online editing platform that I hesitate to shout out for fear of people harassing it. But basically, there's a web link that we'll share with you where all of the changes we've made will be highlighted and you can also roll back all the changes to see what it was previously. It's a live platform, so sometimes we can even be going back and forth with you on the same document talking edits and what not. It's actually very cool! At the end of the day, it's your article. You will always have the final say on whether or not a change is necessary in your article, but we have the final say on what </span><span class="author-a-pz71zvcbs5dhsm0z122zrz89z3">we are willing to publish or not</span><span class="">. So if we feel like an article doesn't meet our content standards we may say no. </span><span class="author-a-pz71zvcbs5dhsm0z122zrz89z3">I</span><span class="">t just typically comes down to playing it by ear.</span><span class="author-a-pz71zvcbs5dhsm0z122zrz89z3"> For example,</span><span class=""> I would </span><span class="author-a-pz71zvcbs5dhsm0z122zrz89z3">be game to</span><span class=""> publish an article from a new voice </span><span class="author-a-pz71zvcbs5dhsm0z122zrz89z3">even while I disagree with their preferred</span><span class=""> word choice </span><span class="author-a-pz71zvcbs5dhsm0z122zrz89z3">in one or two spots,</span><span class=""> as opposed to digging my feet in the mud and saying "Do it this way</span><span class="author-a-pz71zvcbs5dhsm0z122zrz89z3"> or we're </span><span class="author-a-qz85zz83z4z76zz81zz68zz89zkz82z3z76zz72zsz71zt">not going to post this</span><span class="">!!" Depending on how much change needs to happen, we might go through a couple rounds of edits, and then once that's done, it's time for the fun part! Publishing! </span></div>

<div id="magicdomid109" class="ace-line" aria-live="assertive"><span class="">Anyway, publishing! As we get closer to the publication date, I'll reach out to you and ask you what you want to go by for the author name, whether or not you have anything that you want to plug (typically your socials), and if you have a cover image in mind you can give that to me to use as well! If you are bringing your own cover image, it needs to be one that's usable commercially. Not that we're selling anything, but it just helps us avoid any weird liability issues. Then, we upload it to the site on the back end, publish it, spread that shit everywhere, and voila! You're a published author! If you're a part of our Discord server you get a fancy gold name to show you've contributed to the magazine, and if you aren't I alway</span><span class="author-a-pz71zvcbs5dhsm0z122zrz89z3">s</span><span class=""> picture you as a little gold-tinted from that point on. Not only have you contributed to the zoo conversation, as well as allowing me (Tarro) to get an extra couple hours of sleep, you've also created something that didn't exist before, and I think that's kinda cool in its own right!</span></div>

By following the tips in this guide, you can create awesome articles that everyone loves. I've been doing this for a long time. I was writing well before I started running this magazine, so I already have a</span><span class="author-a-pz71zvcbs5dhsm0z122zrz89z3">n authorial</span><span class=""> voice, and a general sense of what I'm trying to do. But we're also more than happy to publish newer authors still finding their footing, so long as they're willing to put in the time and effort, and they're willing to listen to constructive criticism. </span></div>

<div id="magicdomid116" class="ace-line" aria-live="assertive"><span class="">Hopefully, this was a good overview of how to write an article! And if you have any other questions, that's what the team is here for! We're more than happy to help answer any questions that you might have! I would really love to see more articles written by people in the community, and not just because I'd also like to have more free time. I think that as we grow, it's going to be important to give as many people as possible a voice. We're only going to get bigger and bigger from here, but that doesn't mean that every single person doesn't have something interesting to say. </span></div>
