<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I am starting the handmade hero series and he is using Emacs. For the intro to C series I was using Visual Studio 19. But Emacs having that command line type aesthetic intrigued me and I thought I would try it. So in the handmade project, Casey says something to the tune of he has setup a .Emacs file in the misc folder in the main handmade directory.</p> <p>What I can&#39;t wrap my head around is how is he accessing those custom settings he setup for Emacs from any directory? Also how does Emacs know to use those settings? Also how to do all this?</p> <p>I&#39;m sorry if you can&#39;t understand what I am asking because even I don&#39;t understand what I am missing.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/StruckByAnime"> /u/StruckByAnime </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/1e7q0ij/what_is_a_emacs_file_and_how_do_you_make_it_and/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/1e7q0ij/what_is_a_emacs_file_and_how_do_you_make_it_and/">[comments]</a></span>
