<p>In tech-related discourse &#8220;decentralization&#8221;, &#8220;Open Source&#8221;, &#8220;democratization&#8221;, &#8220;federation&#8221; have become weird terms. Not because of the specific architectural or technological concept they are describing but as a way to hide the fact that the speaker thinks that &#8220;markets&#8221; are the cure-all to anything.</p>



<p>Anything is seen as an issue of needing &#8220;more competition&#8221;, &#8220;more choice&#8221; which &#8211; given how many of us have been trained all our lives &#8211; might sound like a great idea. But for a lot of things in life competition is wasteful at best and toxic at worst. Competition in healthcare is what drives the race to the bottom of quality of care and working conditions for the workers for example: The market is optimizing for something that reduces the quality of the service (profit).</p>



<p>Decentralization for example can be very useful to create more technically robust systems (one node going down isn&#8217;t that big of a deal) but it always comes with costs: Moderation of decentralized systems is really hard and takes so much work. Also: The need to choose a service provider/node is a significant burden on users who might not even have enough knowledge to make an informed decision leaving them with a bad feeling. </p>



<p>&#8220;Open source AI models&#8221; sounds great but for many of them nobody can audit the training data (too big) and can&#8217;t reproduce the training (too expensive due to them requiring hyperscalers).</p>



<p>The terms I pointed out (and a few similar ones) have become kind of &#8220;magic&#8221;, they imbue a system or structure with positive vibes while making the relevant discourses on power, fairness, etc. invisible or harder to have by implementing market-based solutions as a given. They have turned into a form of capitalist realism. </p>



<p>So you always have to wonder are these words used in their technical or their magical &#8220;market&#8221; meaning when someone throws them at you.</p>



<p>(I&#8217;m not even gonna get into how &#8220;Open Source&#8221; was invented as a term to depoliticize the free software movement and turn hobbyists into voluntary laborers for big tech)</p>
