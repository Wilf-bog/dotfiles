<p>My laptop’s battery is no longer recharging.  I double-checked: it has
probably malfunctioned.  I need what remains of it to make some final
backups.  I’ll have no regular access to a computer afterwards.  Need to
check for replacements and if they are worth it.  Will reply to your
emails as soon as I can.</p>
