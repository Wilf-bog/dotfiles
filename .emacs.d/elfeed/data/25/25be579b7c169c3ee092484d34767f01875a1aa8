</h3><p>Providing a simple and integrated way of managing your files and browsing your file system.</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@antoniof:gnome.org">antoniof</a> says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Files search is faster. A series of performance optimizations by Carlos Garnacho gave momentum to a testing and developing team effort. There are further optimizations ahead, but the difference can already be felt in the <a href="https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Nightly">Nightly flatpak</a>.</p>

</h3><p>Building blocks for modern GNOME apps using GTK4.</p>

<p>I just landed <a href="https://gnome.pages.gitlab.gnome.org/libadwaita/doc/main/class.NavigationSplitView.html"><code>AdwNavigationSplitView</code></a> - the other part of replacing <code>AdwLeaflet</code>. This widget displays sidebar and content side by side or inside an <code>AdwNavigationView</code>. Meanwhile, <code>AdwHeaderBar</code> automatically hides redundant window buttons when used inside a split view.</p>
<p><code>AdwNavigationSplitView</code> also manages sidebar width as a percentage of the full width when possible, as well as finally allows to implement the style from the original mockups that was impossible with <code>AdwLeaflet</code>

<p><a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/World/Phosh/phosh">Phosh</a> 0.28.0 is out. This is a &ldquo;small things matter&rdquo; release: Several transitions have been smoothed out.  Notifications can unblank the screen and you can set at which urgency this happens. <code>&lt;super&gt;</code>-key can open the overview. Pressing and holding down the volume button works now (no more tapping multiple times). The lockscreen works on smaller displays and libcall-ui was updated to 0.1.0 bringing in some visual improvements.

<blockquote>
<p>This week has been a lot of churn of what used to be called paperwork. With the help with some expert bookkeepers we were able to get the info the accountant needed to file our taxes by their deadline. I am always grateful when we can get expert help; it saves me a lot of time trying to figure it out on my own and I can be more confident in the results.</p>
<p>Speaking of deadlines, today is also the deadline for Executive Director applicants. I&rsquo;ve been collecting the applications and collating them for the search committee to go through. Will spend this weekend and early next week going through them before the next committee meeting.</p>
<p>The travel committee had a lot more requests this year for GUADEC than our budget to handle. Because GUADEC is such a priority for us and being able to send interns is so fundamental to getting them to integrate with our community, I liaised between the committee and the Board to request additional funding. Hoping to be able to process the rest of the travel sponsorships soon.</p>
<p>Speaking of GUADEC, the call for volunteers is still ongoing. If you are attending and have ever wondered what is necessary behind the scenes to get everything running smoothly, this is a great opportunity. Quick form is located here: <a href="https://events.gnome.org/event/101/surveys/14">https://events.gnome.org/event/101/surveys/14</a> — Make sure you also have registered for GUADEC first!</p>
<p>Deadline for GUADEC BoFs or Workshops: June 12 — If you want to run a BoF or Workshop at GUADEC this year but have not submitted a request yet, please do so by June 12. More details here: <a href="https://foundation.gnome.org/2023/05/25/guadec-2023-call-for-bofs/">https://foundation.gnome.org/2023/05/25/guadec-2023-call-for-bofs/</a></p>
