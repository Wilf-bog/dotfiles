<p>As an adult, one of my favourite fairy tales is <strong>Puss in Boots</strong>.</p>
<p>I have immense respect for this talking cat. He has nothing going for him - not even a decent pair of shoes. And to make matters worse he finds himself lumbered with a pretty mediocre human owner.</p>
<p>Folklore academics have a way of classifying the tales they study. It&rsquo;s called the Aarne–Thompson–Uther Index (ATU). And in this index, Puss in Boots is <em>Type 545: the cat as helper</em>.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s completely wrong.</p>
<p>Read it for yourself. This story is not about the frankly lacklustre youngest son of the mill. No, it&rsquo;s about the cat, a cat who has almost no help, who has to do practically everything himself, and who never gives up until finally he gets what he needs.</p>

<p>The great writer Angela Carter would have agreed with this. She observed the cat was “the servant so much the master already“<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. But this is hardly controversial. Perrault&rsquo;s version of the story actually has the title “The Master Cat“.</p>
<p>So as you probably remember, the tale begins when the cat experiences an unexpected disaster. The old miller dies, leaving the mill to his eldest son.</p>
<p>But the mill&rsquo;s cat he leaves to the youngest son.</p>
<p>Not only is the cat suddenly homeless, but to make things even worse his fate is now shackled to a penniless human without prospects.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s a homeless cat to do?</p>
<p>He has no choice. If he&rsquo;s going to survive, he&rsquo;s going to have to create something from nothing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one of the most famous stories of all time. All the great fairy tale compilers included it in their collections: Straparola, Basile, Perrault. When you started reading, did you think, “Puss in Boots? Who&rsquo;s that? No. Almost everyone knows this story.</p>
<p>Puss in Boots made it into the Shrek movies and then headlined two spin-off films himself. He&rsquo;s a star. He started with nothing, a homeless outcast, and ended up making a fortune for everyone who&rsquo;s willing to respect him.</p>
<p>But he never actually sought fortune or fame.</p>
<p>Remember I said he never gives up till he gets what he wants?</p>
<p>And what does a cat want, really? </p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what this whole story was always leading up to (skipping all the bits in the middle, that is). In the ogre&rsquo;s castle the cat tricks the ogre into turning himself into a mouse. Well, with the cat turfed out of the mill, where else is he going to get a feed?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The ogre, enjoying the flattery cried, “I will show you just how powerful I am!”  Instantly he transformed into a tiny mouse scampering around the floor.<br>
In a flash the crafty cat jumped upon the mouse and ate it up.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here&rsquo;s why I like Puss in Boots so much: <em>the story enacts what it tells</em>. Like its feline hero, the story itself started from nothing and became a huge success, making multiple fortunes along the way <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>.</p>
<p>What do I mean by saying the story itself started from nothing? I mean there&rsquo;s hardly any story there. Think about it. The cat simply takes the longest route imaginable to his next meal. Just think about the very first draft:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“One day a cat caught a mouse”.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Almost nothing. Just enough from which to create one of the most popular stories ever.</p>
<p>So tell your story, even if it doesn&rsquo;t yet seem like much of a story.</p>
<p>Like the cat, make yourself up.</p>
<p>Create something from (almost) nothing.</p>
<p>The world waits with baited breath to hear all about it.</p>
