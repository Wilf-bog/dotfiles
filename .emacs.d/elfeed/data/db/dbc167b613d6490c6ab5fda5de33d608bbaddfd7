<p>In this entry, I scaled a mountain to make a philosophical point
pertinent to the titular topic.  This talk is a bit less than an hour
long.  The main ideas:</p>

<ul>
  <li>We sometimes think of self-improvement only as a means to an
ulterior goal, such as money, fame, sex.</li>
  <li>Use the example of climbing to the top of the mountain in hope of
finding those “rewards”.</li>
  <li>Elaborate on the connection between the transactional view of
self-improvement and the concept of entitlement.  The latter was
also covered in my previous talk about <a href="https://protesilaos.com/books/2022-10-17-loss-entitlement-presence/">loss, entitlement, and
presence</a>.</li>
  <li>Explain that self-importance is okay but how it can go awry.  A
relevant theme was covered in my talk about <a href="https://protesilaos.com/books/2022-10-09-self-importance-elitism/">On self-importance and
elitism</a>.</li>
  <li>Discuss how philosophy helps us overcome the self-centric view.  We
do not expect rewards.</li>
  <li>Talk about expectations and entitlement, with a view to how they can
make a person turn their disappointment into a weapon that is used
against others.</li>
  <li>Remark how philosophy helps us remain calm and not go to extremes.</li>
</ul>
