         
         <p>I did an interview with Yuvraj Singh of <em>Syntopikon</em> where I comment
on Emacs, my experiences with computing, political themes, philosophy,
and general life issues:

<p>An excerpt to get you started:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>10. In your About, you write that “What I wrote in the past may not
represent my current views.” What are some views that have changed
or evolved over the past decade?</p>

  <p>[…] I used to express myself in a more verbose way that felt
needlessly professorial.  My mistake was to believe that
sophistication is found in jargon and statements that are hard to
comprehend.  Whereas now I try to state my thoughts in plain terms.
I have confidence in the depth of my views and know how to show that
to the uninitiated.  I do this, for example, with my philosophy
which is practical even though I can make it highly abstract and
obscure.  When I read some philosopher’s cavalierly writings, I get
the sense they are being ridiculous with all that apparent
pretentiousness.  I do not want to impress anyone, especially if
that means I do not communicate my ideas clearly.  If I did fail
this test in the past, it is a mistake I acknowledge through my
current practice.  And if I am currently falling short on some
front, I know I will be able to look back at it and accept it with
honesty.</p>

<p>Syntopikon has interviews with other folks from the Emacs community.
These are the ones I spotted:</p>
