<p>In this ~40 minute walk I comment on the broad theme of productivity
from the perspective of philosophy.  The main idea is that we cannot
factor out the human involved: every method and tool we use has to
work for us.</p>

<p>What I covered in outline:</p>

<ul>
  <li>There is no one-size-fits-all that works for all of us.  It is
important to factor in the subjectivity of the person who will be
applying the method and using the tools.</li>
  <li>Explanation of my bad experience with “Getting Things Done” (GTD),
specifically how it was triggering my completionist mode and made me
feel intimidated by the sheer size of corpus of tasks I had
accumulated.</li>
  <li>I made the mistake of rationalising my inability to work with GTD as
me being defective.  Eventually I realised that I was assuming away
my subjectivity.  I was not inherently broken.  I simply had to find
methods and tools that work for me.</li>
  <li>One has to be honest about their strengths and weaknesses.  Don’t
try to mimic another person.  Instead experiment until you find what
is appropriate for you.</li>
  <li>For me the cost of productivity is what I call “austerity”.  Namely,
the recognition that my intellectual curiosity has to be strictly
moderated so that I do not yield to the temptation of seeking more
information than I can actually process.</li>
  <li>Accountability structures are arrangements that we design to amplify
our strengths while minimising our weaknesses.  I have several such
structures, which I describe in the video.</li>
</ul>
