For this reason, we should go beyond the saying that "there's no ethical consumption under capitalism" and instead think of the idea that there's no ethical consumption or exploitation of sentient people under any system. # Yellow‚≠ê Interesting point

These realizations sparked my vegan identity and passion for animal rights. I began seeing myself as a motivated evangelizer of Francione's veganism and animal rights ideas.

[!quote]+ Highlight ([[zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WP66FEUA?page=6&annotation=8R5B4A9F][Page 6]]) Abolitionist veganism, which uses an animal rights approach, sees the liberation of animals as its ultimate goal and rejects the more dominant form of animal advocacy that seeks the "small steps" approach that focuses on legislative reforms of animal use to make animal use supposedly more "humane." #D√©finitions

[!quote]+ Highlight ([[zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WP66FEUA?page=7&annotation=6YLUGYH7][Page 7]]) every ethical claim is based upon the idea that only people who can fulfill an ethical claim are obligated to do it. And with veganism, if someone circumstantially cannot eat a plant-based diet, that does not necessarily prevent them from being vegan. The history of the vegan movement suggests this, as we shall see.

[!quote]+ Highlight ([[zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WP66FEUA?page=8&annotation=QMTF3HZ9][Page 8]]) Friends, family, and other people we meet throughout our lives shape our worldviews, beliefs, values, and behaviors. Often unbeknownst to us, these worldviews, beliefs, values, and behaviors are defined by our daily interactions. They are also affected by the larger social structures we live under: patriarchy, capitalism, religion, white supremacy, heteroand cisnormativity, governments, and more.

[!quote]+ Highlight ([[zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WP66FEUA?page=8&annotation=E8W2RZH9][Page 8]]) At some point in our lives, we shield ourselves from challenging or complex forms of information.

[!quote]+ Highlight ([[zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WP66FEUA?page=9&annotation=BBVXEVJP][Page 9]]) Should the more privileged be doing most of the work of liberation? Of course. But they will not, in large part, start it or even engage in it. Privilege has a way of placating us into accepting this fantasy of normalcy. But, like so many cases throughout history, it will be the workers, the vulnerable, the severely oppressed who will lead the way and get us on the track to something better.

[!quote]+ Highlight ([[zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WP66FEUA?page=12&annotation=NSETWHEQ][Page 12]]) We have been extremely misled about nonhuman1 animals, veg- anism, and basic science and logic---no wonder we have so many competing views of reality.
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
[!quote]+ Highlight ([[zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WP66FEUA?page=12&annotation=6HD9PHSL][Page 12]]) When we finally have a shared reality in which basic, evidencebased facts are understood and acknowledged, we must come to the same conclusion that veganism is essential, necessary, and attainable by every human on the planet with moral agency.

[!quote]+ Highlight ([[zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WP66FEUA?page=13&annotation=IBWQ9BFM][Page 13]]) Total Liberationist Veganism‚Äù---a veganism that sees all oppressions (nonhuman animal, human, and environmental destruction) as entangled and equally as reprehensible. Total Liberationist Veganism has its roots in the original interpretations of veganism. It exists not as a diet or "personal choice" and lifestyle but as a combination of radical political commitments of beliefs, social practices, and actions. It is anarchist. It is engaged. It is embodied. And it is holistic.

[!quote]+ Highlight ([[zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WP66FEUA?page=13&annotation=3SULXFKV][Page 13]]) Like the Right, the Left has an essentially bankrupt view of nonhuman animals and our relationships with them. Most people care about nonhuman animals; I don't think anyone could dispute that. But how we care about them is the issue.

#+begin_quote
[!quote]+ Highlight ([[zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WP66FEUA?page=15&annotation=NQAR5UWX][Page 15]]) For instance, Brulle, Carmichael, and Jenkins's (2012) research suggests that more information-based advocacy had little effect on influencing concern for the global climate catastrophe overall.

[!quote]+ Highlight ([[zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WP66FEUA?page=15&annotation=FRH7ACIA][Page 15]]) There is other evidence, however, that correcting myths can lead to a reduction in belief in misinformation (Ullrich, Sharkey, and Briony Swire-Thompson 2023).

[!quote]+ Highlight ([[zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WP66FEUA?page=17&annotation=DXHHJUUG][Page 17]]) Logical fallacies can make discussions and debates unproductive at best and impossible at worst. They are defined as "[misconceptions] resulting from a flaw in reasoning, or a trick or illusion in thoughts that often succeeds in obfuscating facts/truth" (Logical Fallacies 2022).

#+begin_quote
[!quote]+ Highlight ([[zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WP66FEUA?page=18&annotation=MSX5MJ66][Page 18]]) An appeal to nature is an argument that relies on basing what is ethically/ morally "good" on what is commonly seen as "natural" and what is "bad" on what is "unnatural." In this form, the use and consumption of nonhuman animals by humans are automatically "good," "natural," and "acceptable" because humans (or other animals like lions) have done it historically.
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
[!quote]+ Highlight ([[zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WP66FEUA?page=18&annotation=WHBYKXPG][Page 18]]) For example, as Leftists, none of us would argue that murder, violation, oppression, discrimination, violence, or domination would be currently acceptable just because human history (and, in some instances, throughout the animal kingdom) is littered with examples.
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
[!quote]+ Highlight ([[zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WP66FEUA?page=20&annotation=CTMMWAPP][Page 20]]) Likewise, whether the early consumption of nonhuman animals aided in human brain size evolution or not has no bearing on how we should behave now.

[!quote]+ Highlight ([[zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WP66FEUA?page=21&annotation=4MFYZWDT][Page 21]]) Thought-terminating clich√©s ‚Ä¢ "Eating animals is a personal choice." ‚Ä¢ "Morality is subjective." ‚Ä¢ "To each their own." ‚Ä¢ "Live and let live." ‚Ä¢ "Agree to disagree." Phrases such as these are a type of rhetoric, which R.J. Lifton (2014) describes as when '[t]he most far-reaching and complex of human problems are compressed into brief, highly reductive, definitivesounding phrases, easily memorized, and easily expressed.‚Äù As Malone (2021:4-5) explains, these statements "aim to stop any further inquiry, development, or criticism of the thought. [Users of this fallacy] want to use the phrase and for that to be an end to the conversation before it can even begin."

#+begin_quote
[!quote]+ Highlight ([[zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WP66FEUA?page=22&annotation=QT2GJQER][Page 22]]) There are your "personal choices," but there are also their personal choices; and their personal choices are, in every respect, being omitted from the equation.

[!quote]+ Highlight ([[zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WP66FEUA?page=22&annotation=UXKIQ8W4][Page 22]]) Tu quoque fallacy ‚Ä¢ "Vegans kill animals, too." ‚Ä¢ "Vegans also have blood on their hands." ‚Ä¢ "Factory farming is bad, but vegans harm human farm workers." This argument relies exclusively on pointing to assumed hypocrisy in vegans or veganism. Called a tu quoque fallacy (pronounced ‚Äútoo qw≈ç-qwƒì)---or an appeal to hypocrisy---the main topic of the discussion is typically derailed so that the vegan advocate must defend their own behaviors.

[!quote]+ Highlight ([[zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WP66FEUA?page=23&annotation=RV67XD6D][Page 23]]) Red herring A vegan says, "Harming other animals is wrong," and someone else responds with: ‚Ä¢ "What about plants, though?" ‚Ä¢ "What about Indigenous rights, though?" ‚Ä¢ ‚ÄúWhat about humane meat, though? This fallacy, intentionally or unintentionally, derails from the original topic

[!quote]+ Highlight ([[zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WP66FEUA?page=23&annotation=UVHM5Z4N][Page 23]]) Perfect solution fallacy / nirvana fallacy ‚Ä¢ "No one is 100% vegan." ‚Ä¢ "Veganism won't solve all the world's problems." Unfortunately, there are no easy solutions to complex issues like human and nonhuman animal exploitation. The perfect solution fallacy---also known as the nirvana fallacy---rejects a proposed solution as not fully fixing a problem

[!quote]+ Highlight ([[zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WP66FEUA?page=26&annotation=HF7ELBXI][Page 26]]) Sentience is concerned with the ability to experience positive and negative experiences (or "any | 26 | feelings"), while consciousness is having an inner life or mind (Jablonka and Ginsburg 2022:402).

[!quote]+ Highlight ([[zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WP66FEUA?page=29&annotation=6IR9SRER][Page 29]]) King Lear, late at night on the cliffs, asks the blind Earl of Gloucester, "How do you see the world?" And the blind man Gloucester replies, "I see it feelingly." And shouldn't we all? Animals must be off the menu because tonight, they are screaming in terror in the slaughterhouses, in crates, and in cages. Vile ignoble gulags of despair. You see, I heard the screams of my dying father as his body was ravaged by the cancer that killed him. And I realized I'd heard those screams before. In slaughterhouses, their eyes stabbed out and their tendons slashed; on the cattle ships to the Middle East; and the dying mother whale, as a harpoon explodes in her brain as she calls out to her calf. Their cries were the cries of my father. I discovered that when we suffer, we suffer as equals. And in their capacity to suffer, a dog is a pig is a bear is a boy. ---Philip Wollen8

[!quote]+ Highlight ([[zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WP66FEUA?page=30&annotation=NW2HGC9B][Page 30]]) It's not too often in this day and age to come across someone who honestly believes that nonhuman animals aren't sentient beings capable of experiencing pain and pleasure, at least from my own experience. There is evidence to suggest, however, that most people underestimate the minds of nonhuman animals (Leach et al. 2023).

[!quote]+ Highlight ([[zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WP66FEUA?page=30&annotation=JGU8YW9F][Page 30]]) Let me be explicit: nonhuman animals are sentient and conscious (Bekoff 2008; Low 2012; Proctor, Carder, and Cornish 2013). - *Ici et apr√®s sont list√©s plusieurs r√©f√©rences sur la consience et sentiences des animaux non-humains.*

#+begin_quote
[!quote]+ Highlight ([[zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WP66FEUA?page=34&annotation=FFTIMCAG][Page 34]]) Even though it isknown that nonhuman animals can experience pain and suffering, wecapture them from their homes and lives. We confine them to oftentight and pain-inducing cages. We violate and exploit their bodies' natural functions. We forcibly breed and impregnate them. We disfigureand genetically alter their bodies. We sometimes kill whole communities of a particular species of nonhuman animals to make way for ourcivilization. We deny them self-determination and bodily autonomy.We torture them. We kill them. We dominate them in all ways possible.They are things, not persons, of total human domination.

#+begin_quote
[!quote]+ Highlight ([[zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WP66FEUA?page=35&annotation=GZJQ92B3][Page 35]]) Then, tragically, in the end, after having done as much as we couldto save their failing bodies, they are taken from us so cruelly and without mercy. We hope their passing brings no added pain or prolongedsuffering for them, but we will always wonder---and we can never besure. And as they lie there, lifeless, and we can no longer experience amutual and loving embrace with them, they take a part of our heartswith them.

#+begin_quote
[!quote]+ Highlight ([[zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WP66FEUA?page=36&annotation=6T7LE49Q][Page 36]]) It might be weird to think of nonhuman animals as "persons" or "people" initially; after all, we typically think of "person" and "people" as synonymous with "human." And when we are referring to both humans and nonhuman animals, we conventionally say something like "people and animals."

[!quote]+ Highlight ([[zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WP66FEUA?page=36&annotation=22GS9I2Y][Page 36]]) When we make a distinction between "humans" and "animals," we are essentially portraying humans outside of the animal kingdom.

#+begin_quote
[!quote]+ Highlight ([[zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WP66FEUA?page=39&annotation=9GBANKCB][Page 39]]) Language is an excellent way to promote action or to stifle it. For instance, the term "climate change" was created in 2003 by Frank Luntz, Republished with full permission from the author. a Republican consultant to then-US President George W. Bush. Luntz, in a now infamous memo, suggested that the way Conservatives could "win" their pseudoscientific war against the science of global warming was to change the common word "global warming" to "climate change." He claimed that the words "global warming" were "frightening" to the public, which would, in turn, incentivize them to action against greenhouse gas emissions; on the other hand, "climate change" made the issue seem less scientifically certain (Burkeman 2003).

[!quote]+ Highlight ([[zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WP66FEUA?page=43&annotation=2EGGC2AR][Page 43]]) As Fran√ßois Jaquet (2021:6) explains, speciesism probably developed (at least in part) from tribalism
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
[!quote]+ Highlight ([[zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WP66FEUA?page=43&annotation=L3SFQA8L][Page 43]]) And while tribalism has evolved throughout history and could have led to speciesism, there is the possibility that "speciesist beliefs are shaped by evolution. If evolution is disconnected from ethical truth, this means that [these speciesist beliefs] are unjustified" (12).

[!quote]+ Highlight ([[zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WP66FEUA?page=44&annotation=MRARFUZ8][Page 44]]) As human groups began to be less nomadic and more sedentary, the domestication of nonhuman animals and plants began. Because of domestication, social hierarchies between and within human groups became more pronounced.

[!quote]+ Highlight ([[zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WP66FEUA?page=44&annotation=MEC6SIA6][Page 44]]) Specifically, control over more nonhuman animals became a status signifier. And while human groups were being more clearly differentiated socially, the environment and nonhuman animals were beginning to become more heavily exploited and became "resources" for humans because doing so could elevate one's status.

What ranchers mean is that grazing cattle can extract value, in the form of commoditized beef, from dry, rocky, difficult to access lands. Of course, such lands are only "marginal" from an instrumental, Lockean view that all land must be worked to create value. But from a biodiversity and ecosystem health perspective, so-called marginal lands can be thriving, biodiverse habitats for myriad flora and fauna, which can be disrupted by the introduction of grazers.

They believe that anyone identifying as "vegan" inherently does not consume or exploit nonhuman animals in any way. To avoid charges of "ableism" and "classism" to this specific interpretation of veganism, they often make the argument that "not everyone can be vegan, and that's OK." This argument makes sense, at first, because it does not place impossible ethical obligations on certain marginalized folks. It simply asks people to do as much as they can; however, those marginalized folks cannot claim the "vegan" identity. I think this is both unnecessary and makes veganism exclusionary. If some of the most marginalized people cannot consider themselves a part of the vegan movement through no fault of their own, it makes veganism an exercise of privilege.

In a world where most people have traded in guns for cameras, has Indian philosophy become unfashionable and politically incorrect among my own people? Can we maintain such traditions and consider ourselves to be ecologically minded? ---Linda Fisher, Indigenous author

With this belief comes the obligation to engage in social practices consistent with this view and that aid in the liberation of all sentient nonhuman animals from human subjugation---to the extent that each individual human's circumstances allow. Furthermore, according to the vegan viewpoint, the oppression of sentient nonhuman animals is inextricably linked to the oppression of humans and the degradation of the environment; thus, true and lasting liberation requires simultaneous commitments and actions toward the liberation of nonhuman animals, humans, and ecosystems.

Proponents of plant consciousness have consistently glossed over the unique and remarkable degree of structural, organizational, and functional complexity that the animal brain had to evolve before consciousness could emerge. Recent results of neuroscientist Todd E. Feinberg and evolutionary biologist Jon M. Mallatt on the minimum brain structures and functions required for consciousness in animals have implications for plants. Their findings make it extremely unlikely that plants, lacking any anatomical structures remotely comparable to the complexity of the threshold brain, possess consciousness.

It was a product of a relational history in which Europeans and Euroamerican traders, missionaries, and settlers believed their civilization was socially and culturally more advanced than the civilizations nurtured by North America's Native peoples. By the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, Europeans and Euroamericans focused their mythologizing on "noble" ecological Indians living in harmony with nature as a way to highlight how Western civilizations had produced spiritually broken people---societies of isolated individuals who had become overly materialistic. In contrast, Europeans and Euroamericans imagined Native Americans as transhistorical figures possessing nurturing feminine qualities that allowed them to remain connected to the rhythms of the natural environment, thereby anchoring an emotive spirituality thought to be long extinguished in the white man's soul.

Second, it essentializes cultures (both majority and minority) as coherent, unitary wholes. Third, it elides ideological, rhetorical, and strategic differences among animal advocates, the mainstream media, politicians, and others, by lumping these distinct entities together as "the dominant group(s)!" Finally the multiculturalist framework denies that animal advocates are in fact as critical (if not more so) of the animal practices of the majority as they are of the animal practices of immigrant minorities.

When a subject is treated as an object,...the experience necessarily evokes a critical consciousness born of the subject's ironic knowledge that he or she is not a thing. #D√©finitions

They concern the need and ability to live in peace, without being subjected to physical and psychological discomfort, stress, distress and trauma, and without their lives being prematurely terminated. These needs and preferences are essential features of the animal standpoint that are easily determinable... (P. 211)

While animals have constituted human existence in beneficial ways, they have seldom been willing partners. The main thesis of animal standpoint theory is that animals have been key determining forces of human psychology, social life, and history overall, and that the domination of human over nonhuman animals underpins the domination of humans over one another and over the natural world.

One cannot adequately assess the moral worth, philosophical depth, and humanity of either cultures or individuals until one examines their views and relations toward animals and the natural world.
