#+title: Emacs configuration
#+author: Frédéric Vachon
#+property: header-args:emacs-lisp :mkdirp yes
#+startup: content indent

This is a new configuration for my own personal use of Emacs starting
on September 1st of 2025. After a few years of playing with Emacs,
using distributions, and copying code from a variety of sources, I've
decided it was finally time to start afresh and actually write my very
own personal configuration. I'll probably keep on integrating code
from other configurations, but the goal is to be more careful and
meticulous in my use of external code. Hopefully, this configuration
will remain short enough to be manageable for me, considering my
limited time and abilities. This whole decision is partly inspired by
Jake's video on Emacs Bankruptcy which can be watched here:
[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSlMmCD5quc&t=200s][Emacs bankruptcy
– fix your Emacs and your life]].

This configuration takes inspiration of a few Emacs users I've been
following over the years and I would like to thank them for their
contribution.

This is a new concept to me as I didn't use an =early-init.el= file
before. From my understanding, since Emacs 27, this file is used to
push configuration that are loaded very early during Emacs'
initialization.

I took heavy inspiration (understand, copying) from Prot's own
configuration here, removing what seems to be pertinent in my own
situation. I kept some settings useful in a tiling window manager
configuration, like frame-resize-pixelwise, even though I tend to only
use Gnome these days. Sway may make a return someday and I would
rather avoid having to play with these settings later on.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle "early-init.el"
  (setq frame-resize-pixelwise t
        frame-title-format '("%b")	; Name of file as the title of the frame
        use-file-dialog nil
        use-short-answers t
        inhibit-startup-screen t
        inhibit-x-resources t
        inhibit-startup-echo-area-message user-login-name
        inhibit-startup-buffer-menu t
        visible-bell t
        )
#+end_src

To make things faster at startup and for my own personal preferences,
I disable early on the GUI parts of emacs.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle "early-init.el"
      ;; (push '(menu-bar-lines . 0) default-frame-alist)
      ;; (push '(tool-bar-lines . 0) default-frame-alist)
      ;; (push '(vertical-scroll-bars . nil) default-frame-alist)

  (tool-bar-mode -1)
  (menu-bar-mode -1)
  (scroll-bar-mode -1)
#+end_src

This is mysterious for me, but these settings for garbage-collection
should help with faster boot time.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle "early-init.el"
(setq gc-cons-threshold (* 10 128 1024 1024))
(setq garbage-collection-messages nil)
#+end_src

Some settings related to packages, taken directly from crafted-emacs
modules about early-init.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle early-init.el

  (require 'package)

  ;;; Setup Emacs Lisp Package Archives (ELPAs)

  (add-to-list 'package-archives '("melpa" . "https://melpa.org/packages/"))

#+end_src

In this larger part of my configuration, I list out all the settings
that are part of the normal initialisation process as well as settings
proper to Emacs' own packages.

** Setting Use-package

First, this line force the use of use-package. I'm not sure if it is
necessary anymore but it doesn't hurt to keep it (as far as I know).

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle init.el
  ;; Built-in since Emacs 29
  (require 'use-package)
#+end_src

** Setting Straight

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle init.el
(defvar bootstrap-version)
(let ((bootstrap-file
       (expand-file-name
        "straight/repos/straight.el/bootstrap.el"
        (or (bound-and-true-p straight-base-dir)
            user-emacs-directory)))
      (bootstrap-version 7))
  (unless (file-exists-p bootstrap-file)
    (with-current-buffer
        (url-retrieve-synchronously
         "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/radian-software/straight.el/develop/install.el"
         'silent 'inhibit-cookies)
      (goto-char (point-max))
      (eval-print-last-sexp)))
  (load bootstrap-file nil 'nomessage))
#+end_src

** TODO Setting up Emacs server for =org-protocol=
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       974b41b3-86e8-405f-a9cc-f48c05ed1c07
:END:

The following code has been provided by this page [[https://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/org-protocol.html][org-protocol.el –
Trigger actions in Emacs via a custom URL scheme]] to make it possible
to run =org-protocol=.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle init.el
(server-start)
(require 'org-protocol)
#+end_src
** =which-key=

Not necessary, but a nice addition, especially when using tools I'm
less familiar with.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle init.el
  (which-key-mode)
#+end_src

** Vertico related Emacs settings
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       38798e8d-d763-465a-9f29-a1046a904925
:END:

To use vertico at its fullest, it's better to set this package so
history isn't lost when restarting Emacs.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle "init.el"
  (use-package savehist
    :init
    (savehist-mode))
#+end_src

Again for Vertico, we do need to change some configuration.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle init.el
  ;; Emacs minibuffer configurations.
  (use-package emacs
    :custom
    ;; Enable context menu. `vertico-multiform-mode' adds a menu in the minibuffer
    ;; to switch display modes.
    (context-menu-mode t)
    ;; Support opening new minibuffers from inside existing minibuffers.
    (enable-recursive-minibuffers t)
    ;; Hide commands in M-x which do not work in the current mode.  Vertico
    ;; commands are hidden in normal buffers. This setting is useful beyond
    ;; Vertico.
    (read-extended-command-predicate #'command-completion-default-include-p)
    ;; Do not allow the cursor in the minibuffer prompt
    (minibuffer-prompt-properties
     '(read-only t cursor-intangible t face minibuffer-prompt))
    :bind
    (;; Keymap for buffers (Emacs28)
     :map ctl-x-x-map
     ("f" . follow-mode)  ; override `font-lock-update'
     ("r" . rename-uniquely)
     ("l" . visual-line-mode)))
#+end_src

** TODO Backup and lockfiles
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       339ad8f1-d0a6-4553-b489-0d5bd31449f4
:END:

# Considering I'm relying on syncthing to be able to share files between
# computers and that my files are auto-saved, lockfiles and backups are
# always been a bit messy. Let's see if disabling those will help with
# that (as well as cleaning my directories!)

I tried for a moment to disable backup files in general, but I learned
from
https://git.sr.ht/~technomancy/better-defaults/tree/main/item/better-defaults.el
that you can specify a specific directory to hold the backup files,
which seems like a great idea to avoid moving those files around with
Syncthing.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle init.el
  (setq make-backup-files t)
  (setq backup-inhibited nil) ; Not sure if needed, given `make-backup-files'
  (setq create-lockfiles nil)

  (unless backup-directory-alist
    (setq backup-directory-alist `(("." . ,(concat user-emacs-directory
                                                   "backups")))))
#+end_src

** Emacs settings about reverting

Considering I work on multiple machines, sometimes at the same time,
and that I rely on Git for many config files, I prefer to
automatically revert the buffers I'm using (files and dired buffers
for example.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle init.el
  ;; Revert buffers when the underlying file has changed
  (global-auto-revert-mode 1)
  
  ;; Revert Dired and other buffers
  (setq global-auto-revert-non-file-buffers t)

  ;; Auto-save mode for org files
  (auto-save-visited-mode +1)
  (setq auto-save-visited-predicate
	(lambda () (eq major-mode 'org-mode)))
#+end_src

To be able to use the newly added bookmarks, this settings make them
immediately available.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle init.el
  (customize-set-variable 'bookmark-save-flag 1)
#+end_src

** Using ibuffer for the buffer list

I rarely make a list of buffers (with =C-x C-b=) but clearly,
~ibuffer~ is a better tool so let's use it instead for that purpose. I
could give it a try more regularly.

Based on Prot's video, this can be very powerful to edit multiple
buffers at the same time, combined with occur for example. See:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KN_oSLFf-k.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle init.el
  (global-set-key [remap list-buffers] 'ibuffer)
#+end_src

** Emacs custom-file

Departing from Emacs Writing Studio defaults, I prefer to stop using
Emacs' config file way of managing settings. Like Prot, I ask Emacs to
rely a temporary file that won't be automatically reloaded.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle "init.el"
(setq custom-file (make-temp-file "emacs-custom-"))
#+end_src

** Emacs windows settings

I used to use a =M-o= to switch window quickly but in line with my
goal of keeping things minimal and to stay close to Emacs' defaults, I
want to get used to =C-x o=. But, when the number of windows get too
high, using =C-x o= gets in the way, and I now prefer to use =M-o= again
since I don't need that keybind for anything else.

I also used to use a package called =balanced-windows= but again I'm
tempted to stay away from it for the moment, and get used to the
command =C-x += which is the default keybinding to balance windows.

For now, no settings are changed until I decide I want to go back to
my old ways.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle init.el
  ;; Switching window quickly
  (global-set-key (kbd "M-o") 'other-window)
#+end_src
** Emacs tabs

I used to use tabs with the defaults options, which means the tabs are
shown when used, and a button is used to delete tabs and another, to
create a new one. By digging into Prot's configurations, I found out
that it could be better to hide those buttons to avoid using the mouse
for tabs management and learning the correct keybindings. We will see
if it is actually useful since I do intend on trying to use Prot's
package ~beframe~.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle init.el
  (use-package tab-bar
    :ensure nil
    :config
    (setq tab-bar-new-button-show nil)
    (setq tab-bar-close-button-show nil)
    (setq tab-bar-show 1))
#+end_src

** TODO Use-package settings

For the moment, my configuration rely only on usepackage that I find
intuitive. To avoid dealing with long init time, I manually add ensure
to all cases of use-package when it's pertinent.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle "init.el"
  (use-package use-package
    :custom
    (use-package-always-ensure nil)	; older config had it true.
    (package-native-compile t)
    (warning-minimum-level :emergency))
#+end_src

** TODO Emacs Web Wowser
Mostly known as EWW, it's the web browser to use on Emacs. I do enjoy
it to read my RSS articles.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle init.el

#+end_src

** TODO Emacs theme settings

To avoid getting asked about trusting themes, we can tell it to treat
all themes as safe by default. I use only a few themes.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle "init.el"
  (setq custom-safe-themes t)
#+end_src

*** Modus themes

I absolutely love Prot's Modus themes, especially Modus Vivendi. I
used to use to tinted version but these days I like the simplicity of
the original. I implemented shortcuts to help me switch theme easily,
inspired by ~Emacs Writing Studio~.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle "init.el"
  (use-package modus-themes
    :custom
    (modus-themes-italic-constructs t)
    (modus-themes-bold-constructs t)
    (modus-themes-mixed-fonts t)
    (modus-themes-to-toggle
     '(modus-operandi modus-vivendi))
    (modus-themes-variable-pitch-ui t)
    (modus-themes-completions '((t . (bold))))
    (modus-themes-prompts '(bold))
    (modus-themes-headings
        '((agenda-structure . (variable-pitch light 2.2))
          (agenda-date . (variable-pitch regular 1.3))
          (t . (regular 1.15))))
    :init
    (load-theme 'modus-vivendi :no-confirm)
    :bind
    (("C-c t t" . modus-themes-toggle)
     ("C-c t m" . modus-themes-select)
     ("C-c t s" . consult-theme)))
#+end_src

*** Auto-dark

I do prefer to switch theme based on light conditions, with Gnome. For
this, I rely on the Auto-dark package. So far it works perfectly well.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle init.el
  (use-package auto-dark
    :ensure t
    :custom
    (auto-dark-themes '((modus-vivendi) (modus-operandi)))
    (auto-dark-polling-interval-seconds 5)
    (auto-dark-allow-powershell nil)
    :init (auto-dark-mode))
#+end_src

** Recent files

Emacs Writing Studio used to introduce some basic settings and
especially a keybinding to list recently edited files. Considering
~consult-buffer~ does a great job to present me the recently edited
file, I didn't had a need for a specific keybinding. Prot's settings
seem perfectly good for my own needs, with a few minor tweaks.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle init.el
  ;; Recent files

  (use-package recentf
    :ensure nil
    :hook (after-init . recentf-mode)
    :config
    (setq recentf-max-saved-items 100)
    (setq recentf-save-file-modes nil)
    (setq recentf-keep nil)
    (setq recentf-auto-cleanup nil)
    (setq recentf-initialize-file-name-history nil)
    (setq recentf-filename-handlers nil)
    (setq recentf-show-file-shortcuts-flag nil)) ; I don't use the recentf tool.
#+end_src

** TODO Text mode
In this section, I'm taking inspiration from Prot's configuration to
improve the experience of writing prose in Emacs. The reasoning comes
from my experience trying to use =fill-mode= like Prot to make reading
prose in text files easier outside of Emacs. After that, I wanted to
make use of =forward-sentence= and =backward-sentence= but I quickly
noticed it didn't work, Emacs considering by default that two spaces
are separators between sentences, which is not a common practice here
at all.

I decided to keep some additional settings Prot added, like the
ability to use text-mode based on the title of a file that may not use
the usual filetypes, like org, txt, etc. I also decided to make use of
=auto-fill-mode= at all times since I appreciate its use after a few
weeks of using the command =fill-paragraph=.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle init.el
;;;; Plain text (text-mode)
(use-package text-mode
  :ensure nil
  :mode "\\`\\(README\\|CHANGELOG\\|COPYING\\|LICENSE\\)\\'"
  :hook
  ((text-mode . turn-on-auto-fill)
   (prog-mode . (lambda () (setq-local sentence-end-double-space t))))
  :config
  (setq sentence-end-double-space nil)
  (setq sentence-end-without-period nil)
  (setq colon-double-space nil)
  (setq use-hard-newlines nil)
  (setq adaptive-fill-mode t))
#+end_src

*** TODO Cycling through different paragraph formats

There are a few options to be able to easily toggle between filled and
unfilled text. This package allows us to unfill a region, a paragraph, etc.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle init.el
  (use-package unfill
    :ensure t)
#+end_src

Sadly, it doesn't offer an easily way to cycle between options, but I
still keep it for the potentially useful =unfill-region=.

Instead, for now I'm relying on this function I took from this
exchange: [[https://emacs.stackexchange.com/a/29699][key bindings - Key mapping: Push `M-q` once for
fill-paragraph and twice for unfill-paragraph - Emacs Stack Exchange]].

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle init.el
  (defun my-fill-paragraph (&optional arg)
    "Fill or unfill paragraph.  If repeated, alternate.
  A prefix arg for filling means justify (as for `fill-paragraph')."
    (interactive "P")
    (let ((fillp  (not (eq last-command 'fill-paragraph))))
      (apply (setq this-command  (if fillp 'fill-paragraph 'unfill-paragraph))
             (and fillp  arg  '(full t)))))
  (keymap-global-set "M-q" #'my-fill-paragraph)

#+end_src

I found out on Sacha's blog some code that allows for cycling through
different text formatting, something that appears to be potentially
really useful. Sadly for now, this code relies on Emacs 31 integration
of semantic line formatting. When I'll be ready to migrate to this
version, I intend on implementing this to replace above code.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defvar my-repeat-counter '()
  "How often `my-repeat-next' was called in a row using the same command.

;; It might be nice to figure out what state we're

** Dired

Dired is my main non-GUI file manager, I've really learned to
appreciate it, though many additional settings are necessary to make
it shine.

First, this new function will be used to add to the normal
~dired-hide-details-information~ function, taken from EFS guides. We
define it first before adding it to Dired's configuration.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle init.el
  (defun hide-dired-details-include-all-subdir-paths ()
    (save-excursion
      (goto-char (point-min))
      (while (re-search-forward dired-subdir-regexp nil t)
	(let* ((match-bounds (cons (match-beginning 1) (match-end 1)))
	       (path (file-name-directory (buffer-substring (car match-bounds)
							    (cdr match-bounds))))
	       (path-start (car match-bounds))
	       (path-end (+ (car match-bounds) (length path)))
	       (inhibit-read-only t))
	  (put-text-property path-start path-end
			     'invisible 'dired-hide-details-information)))))

:END:

This section is mostly centered around org-capture, a crucial tool to
manage my todo-list and more.

Recently, I followed the footsteps of Charles Choi and included his
template to capture web page and a corresponding =BiBTeX= entry to my
own library using =org-protocol=. See [[id:974b41b3-86e8-405f-a9cc-f48c05ed1c07][Setting up Emacs server for
=org-protocol=]] as well as [[http://yummymelon.com/devnull/storing-a-link-from-your-web-browser-to-bibtex-using-org-protocol.html][nfdn: Storing a Link from your Web Browser
to BibTeX using Org protocol]] for more details.

*** Notes drawer

One thing I particularly like of Emacs Writing Studio was the ability
to easily and quickly add a note drawer under a Org header. It is
possible to add drawers with the default configuration, using =C-c x d=
but it's then necessary to name the drawer and it's going to be place
where the point is, which is not what I find the most useful.

Instead, I'm adding this function from Peter Provos.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle init.el
  ;; Notes drawers
  (defun wilf-org-insert-notes-drawer ()
    "Generate or open a NOTES drawer under the current heading."
    (interactive)
    (push-mark)
    (org-previous-visible-heading 1)
    (next-line)
    (org-beginning-of-line)
    (if (looking-at-p "^[ \t]*:NOTES:")
        (progn
          (org-fold-hide-drawer-toggle 'off)
          (re-search-forward "^[ \t]*:END:" nil t)
          (previous-line)
          (org-end-of-line)
          (org-return))
      (org-insert-drawer nil "NOTES"))
    (org-unlogged-message "Press <C-u C-SPACE> to return to the previous position."))

* TODO External packages settings (=init.el=)

I decided to create a separate section this from the precedent to keep
a closer eye on the specific packages I'm adding to my
configuration. We will see if this will remain a sensible option as
the configuration grows.

** Fonts

In this section I set all the settings related to fonts / faces,
including the emojis for additional symbols.

*** Icons (=all-the-icons=)

In addition to normal fonts, I use ~all-the-icons~ to improve the look
and usability of tools like Dired. Nerd-icons seems to be an
alternative worth considering but I don't really have the need to
change for now. Maybe it could be worth it on Windows.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle init.el
  (use-package all-the-icons
    :ensure t)

  (use-package all-the-icons-completion
    :ensure t
    :after (marginalia all-the-icons)
    :hook (marginalia-mode . all-the-icons-completion-marginalia-setup)
    :init
    (all-the-icons-completion-mode))
#+end_src

*** COMMENT Fonts selection

Here I am setting my fonts. After some tries and errors Prot's
aporetic is the only font that manages to look good on any OS without
issues, like visual bugs on Windows or the absence of italics.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle init.el
  ;; Fonts settings

  (dolist (face '(default fixed-pitch))
    (set-face-attribute `,face nil
  		      :font "Aporetic Sans Mono"
  		      :weight 'regular
  		      :height 120))
  (set-face-attribute 'variable-pitch nil
  		    :font "Aporetic Sans"
  		    :weight 'regular
  		    :height 1.0) ; :height 1.0 fix an issue with zooming on EWW
#+end_src

*** Variable pitch

Also, to make sure I'm using variable-pitch fonts, I'm borrowing
Prot's settings for ~face-remap~ to set which modes are to use it.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle init.el
  ;;;;; `variable-pitch-mode' setup
  (use-package face-remap
    :ensure nil
    :bind ( :map ctl-x-x-map
            ("v" . variable-pitch-mode))
    :hook ((text-mode notmuch-show-mode elfeed-show-mode) . wilf/enable-variable-pitch)
    :config
    (defun wilf/enable-variable-pitch ()	;originally, named after Prot.
      (unless (derived-mode-p 'mhtml-mode 'nxml-mode 'yaml-mode)

** TODO Git

For git, I tend to prefer Magit even though it is probably overkill
considering my limited use of git in general. I do enjoy how the tool
is structured and until I take the time to learn Emacs own way of
managing git and other software like this, I'll keep on using Magit.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle "init.el"
  (use-package magit
    :ensure t)

  (add-hook 'magit-process-find-password-functions
  	  'magit-process-password-auth-source)
#+end_src

** TODO Denote

One of the main reason I've switched to Emacs was how great Denote
fitted in the way I've been wanting to write notes in my daily life. I
used to use Obsidian to do so but I didn't like the fact that it was
closed-source first and the rather limited options offered by the
plugins. It always seemed a bit hacky to me and I tended to loose
control of the structure of my notes directory. Denote encourages us
to rely on it's naming format to keep things organized and I love
that. It may seem rather rigid, but it not limited to a vault and can
be used in all sorts of context. I do intend to use this fantastic
tool in the long run.

*** Denote general configuration

The configuration offered by default by Prot is good to me. My
modifications are rather minor.

     ;; Apply colours to Denote names in Dired.  This applies to all
     ;; directories.  Check `denote-dired-directories' for the specific
     ;; directories you may prefer instead.  Then, instead of
     ;; `denote-dired-mode', use `denote-dired-mode-in-directories'.

      ;; If you intend to use Denote with a variety of file types, it is
